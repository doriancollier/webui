DorkOS [VERSION] is the multi-agent release. It introduces Mesh for agent discovery and health monitoring, Relay for inter-agent messaging with delivery tracing, and a unified adapter system that connects agents to external channels like Telegram and webhooks. A standalone roadmap app rounds out the release with full project visibility across table, kanban, MoSCoW, and Gantt views.

## Highlights

**Mesh Agent Discovery** — Register agents into a shared registry with automatic health monitoring, topology visualization, and access control. The Mesh panel in the web UI shows a live network graph of connected agents, their health status, and lets you manage permissions through the new Access tab. Full MCP tool coverage means agents can discover and inspect each other programmatically.

**Relay Message Bus** — Send messages between agents with subject-based routing, delivery tracing, and dead-letter handling. Relay tracks every message through its lifecycle with trace spans, so you can diagnose delivery failures and monitor throughput from the metrics dashboard. The inbox view shows pending messages per endpoint, and the activity feed streams events in real time via SSE.

**Unified Adapter System** — External adapters bridge Relay to the outside world. The Telegram adapter and webhook adapter ship out of the box, and the plugin-based architecture makes it straightforward to add new channels. The Claude Code runtime adapter handles Pulse-dispatched messages, closing the loop between scheduled jobs and agent sessions.

**Standalone Roadmap App** — A dedicated Express + React app for managing project roadmaps. Four views (table with TanStack Table, kanban with drag-and-drop, MoSCoW priority grid, and Gantt timeline) give different perspectives on the same data, persisted in a single `roadmap.json` file via lowdb.

**Pulse Scheduler Enhancements** — The visual cron builder replaces manual cron expression editing, directory picker integration lets you scope scheduled jobs to specific working directories, and calm tech notifications surface run completions without interrupting flow.

**Homepage Rebrand** — The DORK monogram replaces the triangles logo, the Vault module is now Wing, and the litepaper articulates the full DorkOS vision as an OS-layer for AI agents.
