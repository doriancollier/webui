DorkOS 0.5.0 transforms the Relay message bus from a developer-focused system into something humans can actually read — with threaded conversations, friendly labels, and a built-in adapter catalog. The marketing site gets a complete narrative-driven rebuild, and 125+ code quality issues are resolved across the stack.

## Highlights

**Human-Readable Relay** — Messages are now grouped into threaded conversations with friendly labels instead of raw technical subjects. Endpoints, adapters, and dead letters all display human-readable names and message previews, making the activity feed something you'd actually want to look at.

**Adapter Catalog** — Browse, install, and configure external adapters (Telegram, webhooks) from a built-in catalog. Test connections before going live, manage bindings visually in the topology graph, and monitor adapter health with a real-time status bar.

**Dynamic Model Selection** — Choose from all available Claude models dynamically fetched from the Agent SDK, instead of being limited to a hardcoded list.
