DorkOS 0.3.0 introduces the Pulse scheduler — a cron-based system that makes DorkOS autonomous by dispatching prompts to the Claude Agent SDK on a schedule. This release also adds tunnel sharing with QR codes and a comprehensive documentation refresh.

## Highlights

**Pulse Scheduler** — Define cron jobs that run Claude Agent SDK prompts on a schedule. Full observability through the web UI, REST API, and MCP tools. Jobs persist in SQLite, and each run links back to its session transcript.

**Tunnel Toggle with QR Code** — Start and stop ngrok tunnels from the sidebar without restarting the server. Share access instantly via QR code.

**Documentation Overhaul** — All documentation stubs filled, concepts section added, and stale guides rewritten for accuracy.
