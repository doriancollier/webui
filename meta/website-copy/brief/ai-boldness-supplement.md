# Supplemental Brief: The AI Boldness Landscape

Condensed from `research/20260227_ai_agents_reshaping_software_development.md` (40+ sources). Use this as additional context for website copy.

## The Moment

Software development is in a genuine structural shift. AI coding agents have moved from novelty to standard infrastructure. The cultural phenomenon of "vibe coding" (coined by Karpathy) was Collins Dictionary's Word of the Year for 2025. The divide is not between humans and AI — it's between developers who wield AI as a force multiplier and those who don't.

## Key Data Points

| Stat | Source |
|---|---|
| 84% of developers use AI tools (up from 76% in 2024) | Stack Overflow 2025 |
| Only 33% trust AI output (down from 44%) | Stack Overflow 2025 |
| 50% average self-reported productivity boost at Anthropic | Anthropic internal study |
| 27% of Claude-assisted work = tasks that wouldn't have been done otherwise | Anthropic |
| 67% increase in merged PRs per engineer per day post-Claude Code | Anthropic |
| 25% of YC W25 batch has 95% AI-generated codebases | TechCrunch/YC |
| YC W25 = fastest growing, most profitable batch in fund history | CNBC |
| Pieter Levels: $3M/year revenue, zero employees | Multiple |
| Cursor hit $200M ARR faster than any product in history | Today in AI |
| AI Engineer roles up 143% since 2024 | Multiple |
| Entry-level developer hiring down 20-27% | Stanford, BLS, SignalFire |

## The Counter-Narrative (Honest)

- METR study: experienced devs were 19% *slower* with AI on familiar codebases — but *thought* they were 20% faster
- The reconciliation: AI amplifies most on unfamiliar terrain, not where experts are already fast
- Every "developer replacement" technology in 56 years has expanded the market for developers, not shrunk it

## Quotable Framing

- Karpathy evolved from "vibe coding" to "agentic engineering" — orchestrating agents, acting as oversight
- Shopify CEO: "Prove you can't do it with AI before you ask for headcount"
- Anthropic engineers describe becoming "managers of AI agents, taking accountability for fleets of instances"
- Sam Altman's betting pool: the first one-person billion-dollar company

## How This Applies to DorkOS Copy

**Constraint from Decision 4:** Do NOT mock or belittle people who are afraid of AI. Invite them. Make the bold path feel achievable, not exclusive.

**The angle:** The developers who build agent teams will outship those who don't. DorkOS is the infrastructure that makes that possible. The fear is real — but the answer isn't to avoid AI. It's to have the right tools to make AI trustworthy, observable, and under your control.

**The 84/33 trust gap** is the product opportunity: developers use AI but don't trust it. DorkOS addresses trust through oversight (Console), communication (Relay), and coordination (Mesh).
