# Website Copy Decisions Log

Tracking key creative decisions as they're made.

---

## Decision 1: The Panel

**Date:** 2026-02-27
**Decision:** Use 5 creative agents — Ogilvy (craft), Jobs (narrative), Godin (positioning), Ive (aesthetic), Wieden (provocation)
**Rationale:** Covers the full spectrum from strategic positioning to emotional gut-punch. Dan Wieden specifically for Nike-level identity work (coined "Just Do It").

## Decision 2: Process — Start With Concept, Not Slogan

**Date:** 2026-02-27
**Decision:** Round 1 asks for the organizing concept, not a tagline. A slogan is the compression of a concept — you need the concept first.
**Rationale:** Starting with slogans produces clever lines with no structural integrity. Starting with concepts produces a site where every section reinforces the same idea.

## Decision 3: Reject "Employment" Metaphor

**Date:** 2026-02-27
**Decision:** Ogilvy's "tool → employee" framing is rejected. Too corporate. The relationship between human and agent should use language like "work with," "teammate," "collaborate," "crew" — not "employ," "worker," "hire."
**Nuance:** The human is the lead. Human and agent are not peers. But the tone is warm and collaborative, not managerial. Think: a builder with a crew, not a boss managing headcount.
**Aligns with:** Brand foundation already says "Agents work **like** teammates" (not "are teammates"). The "like" is important — it acknowledges the analogy without overclaiming.

## Decision 4: Add "AI Boldness" Dimension

**Date:** 2026-02-27
**Decision:** The site should speak to developers who are bold enough to embrace AI agents — the ones leaning into the future, not fearing it. This isn't about dismissing AI fear. It's about embodying the answer: the developers who build AI teams will outship those who don't.
**Constraint:** Do not mock or belittle people who are afraid. Invite them. Make the bold path feel achievable, not exclusive.
**Research:** Complete — see `research/20260227_ai_agents_reshaping_software_development.md` (40+ sources).

## Decision 5: Hero Headline — Test Both in Round 2

**Date:** 2026-02-27
**Decision:** Don't choose between long-form (Ogilvy) and short-form (Jobs/Wieden) yet. Have agents write both versions in Round 2 and pick after seeing them in homepage context.
**Rationale:** Both styles have merit. Better to compare in situ than in the abstract.

## Decision 6: Site Feel — Hybrid (Narrative + Boot Sequence)

**Date:** 2026-02-27
**Decision:** Narrative scroll structure (problem → villain → product → install → tribe) with boot-sequence visual treatment (Ive's design language). Story arc drives the sections, but the aesthetic feels like an OS activating.
**Nuance:** Keep Ive's aesthetic direction — dark screen, subsystem activation, machined typography, monospaced system names, generous whitespace. But the *content flow* follows the emotional narrative arc, not a literal boot sequence.

## Decision 7: Primary Tagline — "You slept. They shipped."

**Date:** 2026-02-27
**Decision:** "You slept. They shipped." is the primary tagline. Goes on stickers, README, Twitter bio, meta descriptions.
**Rationale:** Three words + three words. Subject, verb. Subject, verb. Identity over features. Centers the developer (you slept) and the outcome (they shipped). Passed Wieden's sticker test and Godin's word-of-mouth test.
**"Your AI Never Sleeps":** Demoted to Pulse module section header. It's a feature line, not an identity line.

## Decision 8: Module Presentation — Timeline-First with Reference Table

**Date:** 2026-02-27
**Decision:** Lead with Wieden's timeline narrative (11:14pm → 2:47am → 7:00am) as the primary presentation. Support with a clean gap→fix reference below or alongside for the architect persona.
**Rationale:** Autonomous agents are a new concept. Story cements the idea in people's heads better than a table. But the technical persona also needs to quickly map "what does each module do?" — so a compact reference follows the story.
**Aligns with:** Godin's observation that the product modules should feel like *answers* to problems the reader already felt.

## Decision 9: Hero Headline — Jobs Short-Form

**Date:** 2026-02-27
**Decision:** "Your agents are brilliant. They just can't do anything when you leave."
**Rationale:** Two lines. First builds warmth. Second drops the floor out. No wasted syllable. Punchy and immediate.
**Long-form (Wieden) kept as reserve:** "You closed the laptop at 11pm..." — available for blog posts, launch announcements, or anywhere longer-form copy fits.

## Decision 10: Villain Card 4 — The 3am Build

**Date:** 2026-02-27
**Decision:** Use Wieden's "The 3am Build" as the fourth villain card instead of "The Flow Killer."
**Copy:** "CI went red at 2:47am. The fix was three lines of code. Your agent knew exactly what to do. Your terminal was closed. The build stayed red until morning."
**Rationale:** Aligns with the 2:47am motif that runs through the timeline. Reinforces the tagline's "you slept" energy. The Flow Killer addresses the Priya persona — can surface on secondary pages or docs.

## Decision 11: New Lines — "Leave the rest to them." + "They need an address."

**Date:** 2026-02-27
**Decision:** Two new lines added to the brand vocabulary:
1. **"Leave the rest to them."** — Replaces Wieden's "Close the laptop" (which was technically inaccurate since local agents die when the laptop closes). Collaborative handoff energy. Use: final site line, stickers, social.
2. **"Your agents don't need more intelligence. They need an address."** (Jobs) — Nine words. Reframes the product as giving agents a place to exist. Use: pivot alternative, social, README.
**Rejected:** "Close the laptop." — emotionally perfect but technically dishonest for a local-first product.
**Noted but not adopted:** "The quiet part is the architecture." (Ive) and "They have an infrastructure problem." (Godin) — strong lines, available for future use.

## Decision 12: Keep Existing Design System — Unanimous

**Date:** 2026-02-27
**Decision:** The cream palette, IBM Plex fonts, brand orange (#E85D04), graph paper texture, motion variants, and all current design tokens stay unchanged. Zero new CSS variables. Zero new fonts.
**Rationale:** All 5 agents unanimously agreed the existing warm retro-tech aesthetic is stronger than the dark vision (#0A0A0A) proposed in the Round 2 copy. The cream palette is warmer, more distinctive, and more confident than the dark terminal aesthetic every other developer tool defaults to. The copy is voice-driven, not design-driven — it works on cream.

## Decision 13: Honesty Section — Keep & Move

**Date:** 2026-02-27
**Decision:** Keep the Honesty Section with corner brackets and green eyebrow. Move it from current position (between How It Works and About) to between Module Reference and Install Moment.
**Rationale:** Ogilvy + Wieden argument: in a page with this much emotional architecture, a moment of radical honesty is a credibility anchor. The developers who will adopt DorkOS will notice the *absence* of a privacy disclosure. Copy tightened. Brackets stay — they're a signature element.

## Decision 14: Hero Layout — Stacked (Headline Over Feed)

**Date:** 2026-02-27
**Decision:** Headline spans full width at top of hero. Activity feed appears below, subordinate. Words first, evidence second.
**Rationale:** 4 of 5 agents recommended stacking (Wieden, Godin, Jobs, Ive). The new headline creates tension that the feed resolves — but only if the reader feels the headline first. Current side-by-side layout lets the eye go to the moving element before reading the words, which undermines the problem statement.

## Decision 15: Prelude — Dark Then Cream

**Date:** 2026-02-27
**Decision:** The Prelude ("DorkOS is starting.") uses a brief dark background (charcoal #1A1814) before transitioning to the cream palette. Holds ~1.2 seconds, then fades.
**Rationale:** Ive's insight — a single moment of darkness makes the warm cream feel like awakening. The system turns on. Reinforces the boot-sequence hybrid aesthetic without breaking the overall warm palette.
