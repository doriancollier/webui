# The Creative Concept for DorkOS

## A Memorandum from David Ogilvy

---

## I. The Concept

**DorkOS is the operating system that turns your AI agent from a tool you operate into a worker you employ.**

The organizing concept is **the shift from session to employment** — from an AI you babysit in a terminal to an AI that works on your payroll, around the clock, across every project, reporting back like a competent colleague.

---

## II. Why It Works

I have spent the morning studying this brief, and I observe the following:

Every piece of evidence in this document — every developer quote, every pain point, every feature — points to one fundamental problem. It is not a problem of capability. Claude Code is, by all accounts, extraordinarily capable. The problem is one of **employment structure**. These developers have hired the most brilliant contractor in history and given them no desk, no schedule, no way to reach them after hours, and no memory of yesterday's work.

Consider the developer quotes you have collected. They are research, and research is the foundation of everything:

One developer runs Claude Code across ten terminal tabs. Another uses it overnight exclusively because it is not worth their time during the day. A third complains it starts every session with zero context — "a goldfish." A fourth dreams of waking up to find overnight PRs completed.

What do these four people want? They do not want a better chat interface. They do not want a wrapper. They want to **employ** their AI agent. Give it a schedule. Give it a mailbox. Give it colleagues. Give it memory. Give it the infrastructure that any competent employer provides to any competent worker.

This is not a metaphor I am inventing. It is the reality your product delivers. Pulse is a schedule. Relay is inter-office communication. Mesh is a company directory. Wing is institutional memory. The Console is a management dashboard. You have built, quite literally, the HR department and office infrastructure for AI agents.

The reason this concept will outperform "Your AI Never Sleeps" — which is a good line, but a limited one — is that sleep is only one dimension of the problem. The developer who re-introduces context for the hundredth time is not suffering from a sleep problem. The developer juggling fifteen tabs is not suffering from a sleep problem. They are suffering from the absence of an employment relationship with their agent.

When you tell a developer "Your AI Never Sleeps," you have promised them one thing: uptime. When you tell them "You have the most capable developer in the world, and you have given them nothing but a terminal and amnesia," you have described their entire problem. And then DorkOS becomes the entire solution.

I should add: this concept has the advantage of being **literally true**. You are not stretching a metaphor. An operating system provides processes, scheduling, inter-process communication, a filesystem, and user management. That is exactly what an employer provides a worker: tasks, a schedule, communication channels, a filing system, and an org chart. Your product name already contains the answer. It is an operating system. Operating systems let things work.

## III. How It Plays Out

### 1. The Hero Section

The headline does not announce the product category. It announces the problem with devastating specificity.

> **You hired the smartest developer who ever lived. Then you gave them amnesia, no schedule, and a terminal that closes when you look away.**
>
> DorkOS is the operating system for AI agents. It gives Claude Code a schedule, a mailbox, a memory, and colleagues — so it works like an employee, not a parlor trick.
>
> `npm install -g dorkos`

This is long. I know it is long. I tested long headlines at Ogilvy & Mather for twenty years. Headlines of ten words sell more than headlines of five. Headlines that convey a specific promise — not a mood, not a vibe, a **promise** — outperform clever brevity every time. The developer who reads this headline will recognize their own Tuesday night. That recognition is worth more than any amount of typographic minimalism.

### 2. The Problem Section (Before DorkOS)

Do not call this section "The Problem." Call it what the developer calls it:

> **The way it works now**

Then list the villains from your brief, but frame each one as an employment failure:

- **No schedule.** Your agent works when you open a terminal. Closes when you close it. The most capable developer you have ever worked with — available only during your working hours, in your presence, at your desk.
- **No memory.** Every session starts from zero. You brief your agent like it is day one, every day, forever. Imagine onboarding a senior engineer every morning.
- **No communication.** Your agents cannot talk to each other. They cannot send you a message. They finish work and tell no one. The PR sits there until you stumble across it.
- **No colleagues.** You run five agents across five projects. None of them know the others exist. No handoffs. No coordination. Five brilliant developers in five sealed rooms.

This section works because it does not attack the competition. It attacks the **status quo**. The status quo is always the real competitor.

### 3. The Feature Walkthrough (The Infrastructure)

Each module is presented not as a feature but as an element of infrastructure that any employer provides:

| What every worker gets | What your AI agent gets | DorkOS module |
|---|---|---|
| A schedule | Cron-based autonomous execution | **Pulse** |
| A mailbox | Inter-agent message bus | **Relay** |
| An org chart | Agent discovery and registry | **Mesh** |
| Institutional memory | Persistent context across sessions | **Wing** |
| A desk | Browser-based command center | **Console** |
| A performance review | Self-improvement engine | **Loop** |

This table does more selling than a paragraph of prose. It makes the abstract concrete. It connects each feature to something the developer already understands. And it reveals the scope of the product without requiring the developer to read seven feature descriptions.

### 4. The Origin Story

Your founder's story is extraordinary. Do not bury it. Do not soften it. The best advertising tells the truth about who made the product and why.

> **Built by a dork**
>
> Dorian Collier learned to code from library books. No connections. No safety net. Professional programmer before he finished high school. Built products that reached thirty million users. Named DorkOS after himself — because the people who build at 3am, who care too much, who cannot stop tinkering, deserve tools that are unapologetically theirs.

The word "dork" is your greatest asset. Do not run from it. It is a word that means "someone who cares too much about something most people do not care about at all." That is your entire audience. That is the identity they already hold. You are not asking them to adopt a new identity. You are giving them permission to wear the one they already have.

### 5. The Call to Action

Do not write "Get Started." Do not write "Try It Free." Write something that continues the concept:

> **Give your agent a job.**
>
> `npm install -g dorkos`
>
> Open source. Self-hosted. Yours.

Three words at the end — "Open source. Self-hosted. Yours." — do the work of an entire trust section. They answer the three objections a technical user has before they will install anything: Is it open? Do I control it? Will it be taken away?

## IV. The Line

If I must reduce this to a single headline for the homepage, it is this:

> **You hired the smartest developer who ever lived. Then you gave them amnesia, no schedule, and a terminal that closes when you look away.**

The subhead:

> **DorkOS gives your AI agents the infrastructure to work like employees — not tools.**

And if you need a shorter tagline for social, merchandise, or word-of-mouth:

> **Give your agent a job.**

This is better than "Your AI Never Sleeps" because it implies everything that line says (24/7 operation) while also implying memory, communication, coordination, and autonomy. "Never Sleeps" is one feature. "Give your agent a job" is the whole product.

---

## V. What to Kill

**"Your AI Never Sleeps"** — Demote this. It is a good line, but it is a feature headline, not a concept. It belongs on the Pulse scheduler section, not on the homepage. It promises uptime. Your product promises much more than uptime.

**"Built by dorks. For dorks. Run by you."** — Keep the sentiment, but this is three separate thoughts competing for attention. "Built by a dork" works for the origin story. "Run by you" works for the self-hosted message. Combining them dilutes both.

**"We solved this for applications fifty years ago. We called it an operating system."** — This is clever, and I distrust cleverness. It makes the speaker sound smart. It does not make the reader feel understood. The reader does not care what we solved fifty years ago. The reader cares about the fact that their agent forgot everything overnight. Kill the historical reference. Keep the word "operating system" — it earns its place because it is accurate.

**"The ones who care too much build the things that matter most."** — This is a poster, not a selling proposition. It makes people nod. It does not make people install. Keep it for conference talks or README files. Remove it from the website. Every line on the website must either (a) identify the reader's problem, (b) present DorkOS as the solution, or (c) reduce friction to installation. This line does none of those three things.

---

## A Final Note

I have been asked many times whether long copy sells. The answer, supported by every piece of research I have conducted over forty years, is that **specific** copy sells. Long copy that is vague is worse than short copy that is specific. But long copy that is specific — that names the problem, quantifies the solution, and tells the reader exactly what they will get — outperforms short copy every time.

Your audience is developers. They read documentation for recreation. They will not be frightened by a long page. They will be frightened by a page that wastes their time with vague promises and gradient backgrounds.

Give them the truth. Give them specifics. Give them a command they can paste into their terminal. That is all advertising has ever been: the truth, told well, to the right person, at the right moment.
