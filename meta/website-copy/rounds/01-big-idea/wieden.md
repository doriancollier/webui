# Round 1: The Concept

## The Concept

**Your agent is only as good as the hours you give it.**

DorkOS is the campaign against presence. Against the idea that the most powerful AI on earth needs you sitting there, watching it type. The concept is simple: **You are the bottleneck. Remove yourself.**

Every developer using Claude Code right now is doing the same thing — babysitting genius. They hired the best engineer on the planet and then chained it to their desk chair. DorkOS unchains it.

The organizing concept for the entire site is **the absurdity of human-gated intelligence.**

## Why It Works

Because it is true. And truth is the only thing that sells to people who think for a living.

Every developer already feels this. They close the laptop and the agent dies. They go to sleep and the CI stays red. They context-switch to Slack and the session evaporates. They know the agent could be working. They know it is not. And they feel that — not as a feature gap, but as a waste.

You do not sell DorkOS by listing features. You sell it by naming the thing they already resent. The dead terminal. The goldfish memory. The silent machine at 3am when the build is broken and the agent that could fix it is waiting for a human who is unconscious.

Nike did not sell shoes. Nike sold the person you become when you stop making excuses. DorkOS does not sell infrastructure. DorkOS sells what happens when you stop standing in your agent's way.

## How It Plays Out

**1. The Hero Section**

No product screenshot above the fold. Just the line and a terminal clock frozen at 2:47am with a blinking cursor. The implication: your agent was ready. You were not.

Below it, one sentence: *The operating system for AI agents that work when you don't.*

Then the install command. Nothing else.

**2. The Villain Section — "The Dead Terminal"**

A short scroll section that names the enemy. Not competitor products. The workflow itself.

> You hired the most capable engineer on earth. Then you chained it to your laptop lid.

Three cards. Each one a moment of waste:
- **The 3am Build** — CI red for four hours. The fix was three lines. Your agent knew. Your terminal was closed.
- **The Goldfish** — Every session starts from zero. No memory of yesterday. No memory of five minutes ago.
- **The Tab Graveyard** — Ten agents. Ten terminals. No communication. No coordination. Just you, alt-tabbing like it is 2005.

**3. The Identity Section — "Built by Dorks"**

This is where you claim the tribe. Not apologetically. Not ironically. Directly.

> Dork was never an insult to us. It is what you call someone who cares too much about something most people do not care about at all. We build at 3am because we cannot stop. We name our agents. We have opinions about cron expressions. We are dorks. And the things that matter most are built by people like us.

This replaces an "About" section. It does not explain the company. It identifies who belongs here.

**4. The Product Walkthrough — "What Happens When You Leave"**

Not a feature list. A narrative. Show what DorkOS does as a timeline of a developer's night:

- **11:14pm** — You schedule three tasks. Pulse queues them.
- **11:15pm** — You close the laptop.
- **2:47am** — CI breaks. Relay routes the alert. An agent picks it up.
- **2:51am** — Fix committed. PR opened. Tests green.
- **7:00am** — You open DorkOS. Three PRs merged. Status: all clear.

The section header: *You slept. They shipped.*

**5. The CTA**

Do not beg. Do not explain. One line:

```
npm install -g dorkos
```

And beneath it: *One person. Ten agents. Ship around the clock.*

## The Line

The headline for the entire site. The thing that goes on the sticker, the README, the Twitter bio:

**You slept. They shipped.**

Three words and three words. Subject, verb. Subject, verb. The contrast does all the work. It says: you are not needed for execution. You are needed for intent. Set the direction and go to bed. That is the DorkOS promise.

If you need a secondary line for contexts where the primary feels too compressed:

**The operating system for agents that work when you don't.**

## What to Kill

**"Your AI Never Sleeps."** — Kill it. It centers the AI. Nobody cares that the AI does not sleep. They care that *they* can. The shift from "your AI never sleeps" to "you slept, they shipped" is the shift from feature to identity. From what the product does to who you become.

**"We solved this for applications fifty years ago. We called it an operating system."** — Keep it, but bury it. It is clever. Too clever for a headline. It belongs in a blog post or a deep-scroll explainer section for the architect persona. It earns a nod, not a feeling. And the homepage needs to earn a feeling.

**"One Person. Ten Agents. Ship Around the Clock."** — Keep it. It is a strong CTA closer. It works beneath the install command because it paints the picture of what life looks like after install. That is exactly where it belongs.

---

The entire site should feel like opening your laptop in the morning and seeing work you did not do, done right. That is the emotion. That is the product. That is the campaign.
