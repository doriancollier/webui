# The Concept

**DorkOS is the moment your agents stop being tools and start being employees.**

Not metaphorically. Literally. You schedule them. They report back. They talk to each other. They remember what happened yesterday. They show up at 3am and do the work you queued before bed. The website should be organized around one idea: **the shift from using an agent to running agents.**

---

# Why It Works

Every developer who lands on this site already has an AI coding agent. That battle is over. They chose Claude Code or Cursor or Copilot. What they do not have — what nobody has given them — is the answer to a question they have only recently started asking:

*Why does my most powerful tool forget everything the moment I close the terminal?*

That is the tension. And the resolution is not a feature list. It is a conceptual leap. The same leap that happened when computers went from calculators to operating systems. When phones went from making calls to running apps. The object did not change. The relationship to the object changed.

DorkOS does not make agents smarter. It makes agents *operational*. That word — operational — is the whole thing. An agent that runs when you tell it to, stops when you close the lid, and forgets everything in between is a tool. An agent that runs on a schedule, communicates with other agents, remembers context across sessions, and reports what it did while you slept — that is something else entirely.

The website should make the visitor feel that shift in their bones before a single feature is explained.

# How It Plays Out

**1. The Opening.**
The site opens not with what DorkOS is, but with what your current reality looks like. A single provocative line. Then the flip.

> You have the most powerful AI coding agent ever built.
> It only works when you are watching.

Pause. Then:

> What if it didn't?

That is the entire above-the-fold. Nothing else. No feature grid. No install command yet. Just the question that reframes everything.

**2. The Narrative Walkthrough.**
Below the fold, the site tells a story. Not "here are seven modules." A day. Kai's day. Before DorkOS, after DorkOS. The left column is the world they know: terminal tabs, re-introductions, missed PRs, dead sessions. The right column — or the scroll-triggered reveal — is the world where agents are operational. Pulse scheduled the overnight build. Relay told the frontend agent the API changed. Mesh found the right agent for the job. Console showed you everything when you opened your laptop at 7am.

The modules are never presented as a list. They are revealed as answers to moments of friction the developer already recognizes.

**3. The OS Metaphor — Earned, Not Stated.**
Halfway down the page, after the visitor has already felt the shift, you earn the right to say what this actually is:

> We solved this for applications fifty years ago. We called it an operating system.

This line already exists in the brief and it is perfect — but only if it arrives after the emotional setup. If you lead with it, it sounds like a claim. If you earn it, it sounds like an inevitability.

**4. The Install Moment.**
The install command appears exactly once, and it appears at the moment of maximum desire — after the story, after the "oh, that is what this is" realization. One line. One command. No pricing table, no signup form, no "get started" button that leads to a form.

```
npm install -g dorkos
```

That is the call to action. The simplicity of it is the statement. This is not a platform you join. It is software you run.

**5. The Community Close.**
The bottom of the site is not a footer. It is an invitation. "Built by dorks. For dorks. Run by you." This is where the origin story lives — not as a founder bio, but as a single line that says: this was built by someone who needed it, for people who need it, and it belongs to all of them.

---

# The Line

The primary headline for the site:

> **Your agents are brilliant. They just have no idea what to do when you leave the room.**

The tagline beneath it, or the resolution after the scroll:

> **DorkOS: the operating system for autonomous AI agents.**

"Your AI Never Sleeps" is strong as a secondary line — it belongs on the Pulse section or as a pull quote — but it should not be the primary headline. It describes a feature. The headline above describes the *problem*, and problems are what create desire.

---

# What to Kill

**Kill "Your AI Never Sleeps" as the primary tagline.** It is a good line but it is a conclusion. It tells people what to think before they have felt the problem. Move it to the Pulse section where scheduling is introduced. Let it be the punchline of that specific module, not the thesis of the site.

**Kill any temptation to lead with the seven-module architecture.** Modules are implementation. Nobody falls in love with architecture. They fall in love with the moment they realize their overnight CI failure could have been caught and fixed before they woke up. Reveal the modules inside the story, never as a grid at the top.

**Kill "Built by dorks. For dorks. Run by you." as a tagline.** It is a closing line — warm, honest, communal. It should be the last thing they read, not the first. Opening with it undermines the technical credibility you need to establish first.

**Keep the OS metaphor.** It is the most powerful conceptual tool in the entire brief. But it must be earned through narrative, not asserted in a headline. When a visitor scrolls past the before/after story and arrives at "We solved this for applications fifty years ago," it should feel like they figured it out themselves. That is when a concept becomes a conviction.

---

The website has one job: make a developer close the tab and immediately open their terminal. Everything on the page either accelerates that moment or delays it. Build for the moment. Kill everything else.
