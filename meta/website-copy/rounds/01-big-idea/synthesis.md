# Round 1 Synthesis: The Big Idea

## The Convergence

All five agents independently arrived at the same core insight. This is significant — when five radically different creative minds agree on the problem, the problem is real.

**The unanimous insight:** The website should NOT lead with what DorkOS is. It should lead with what's broken — the absurd gap between how capable AI agents are and how crippled their working conditions are.

Every agent rejected "Your AI Never Sleeps" as the primary headline. Every agent said: lead with the problem, not the solution.

## What Each Agent Contributed

| Agent | Core Concept | Best Line | Unique Contribution |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Ogilvy** | Session → Employment | "Give your agent a job." | The employment infrastructure table (schedule = Pulse, mailbox = Relay, org chart = Mesh). Devastating specificity. |
| **Jobs** | Tool → Operational | "Your agents are brilliant. They just have no idea what to do when you leave the room." | Narrative walkthrough (Kai's day, before/after). OS metaphor must be *earned*, not stated. |
| **Godin** | Intelligence ↔ Infrastructure gap | "You know how Claude forgets everything between sessions? Someone built an OS for that." | The "word of mouth sentence" test. Tribal recognition as the purple cow. |
| **Ive** | Boot sequence as website experience | "DorkOS is starting." / "Ready." | The site itself should feel like an OS initializing. Subsystems activating on scroll. |
| **Wieden** | Human-gated intelligence | "You slept. They shipped." | The 2:47am timeline. Identity over features. The sticker test. |

## The Synthesized Concept

**The gap between brilliant and broken.**

Your AI agents are the most capable developers who ever existed. And they have no schedule, no memory, no way to reach you, and no idea what happened five minutes ago. That's not an intelligence problem. That's a missing operating system.

DorkOS closes the gap.

### Why this works as the organizing concept:

1. **It's felt, not explained.** Every developer in the audience has experienced this gap personally.
2. **It unifies all seven modules.** Each module is an answer to a specific dimension of the gap.
3. **It makes the OS metaphor inevitable.** When you see all the gaps listed, the word "operating system" feels like a discovery, not a claim.
4. **It's shareable.** Godin's test: "You know how Claude forgets everything? Someone built an OS for that."

## The Site Structure (Synthesized from all 5)

### 1. Hero — The Problem (above the fold)

Open with the gap. Not the product. Not the category. The felt absurdity.

**Primary headline** (combining Jobs + Wieden):
> Your agents are brilliant. They just can't do anything when you leave.

**Or** (Ogilvy's long-form option):
> You hired the smartest developer who ever lived. Then you gave them amnesia, no schedule, and a terminal that closes when you look away.

**Subhead:**
> The operating system for autonomous AI agents.

**CTA:**
> `npm install -g dorkos`

### 2. The Villain — Recognition (first scroll)

Name the specific moments. Not abstract. Felt. (Wieden's "Dead Terminal" cards + Godin's punchline approach)

- The dead terminal — agent shipped code, told no one
- The goldfish — every session starts from zero
- The tab graveyard — ten agents, no coordination
- The flow-killer — 15 minutes lost for a 10-second answer

Then the pivot (Jobs): *"We solved this for applications fifty years ago. We called it an operating system."*

This line earns its place mid-page, after the emotional setup. Not as the opener.

### 3. The Product — Answers, Not Features

Reveal modules as answers to the villain moments (Godin + Ogilvy):

| The gap | The fix | Module |
|---|---|---|
| No schedule | Cron-based autonomous execution | Pulse |
| No communication | Built-in messaging + Telegram | Relay |
| No colleagues | Agent discovery and network | Mesh |
| No memory | Persistent context across sessions | Wing |
| No oversight | Browser-based command center | Console |
| No improvement loop | Signal → hypothesis → dispatch | Loop |

**Or** as Wieden's timeline narrative:
- 11:14pm — schedule tasks
- 11:15pm — close the laptop
- 2:47am — CI breaks, agent fixes it
- 7:00am — three PRs merged, status clear

### 4. The Install Moment — Maximum Desire

One line, after the story, at the moment of peak wanting (Jobs + Ive):

```
npm install -g dorkos
```

Ive: presented like a terminal prompt — monospaced, high contrast, generous whitespace. The gravity of an action, not a suggestion.

Below it: *Open source. Self-hosted. Yours.* (Ogilvy)

### 5. The Identity Close — The Tribe

Not a footer. An invitation. (Wieden + Ogilvy)

The "Built by dorks" section — not as the opening, but as the close. The tribal handshake after you've earned it.

Origin story as provenance stamp (Ive): brief, factual, present without demanding attention.

## Lines to Keep

| Line | Where it lives | Why |
|---|---|---|
| "Your AI Never Sleeps" | Pulse section header | It's a feature line, not a concept. Perfect for the scheduling module. |
| "Built by dorks. For dorks. Run by you." | Identity close / footer | Closing tribal line, not opener. Premature at the top. |
| "We solved this for applications fifty years ago." | Mid-page pivot | Only works AFTER the emotional setup. |
| "One Person. Ten Agents. Ship Around the Clock." | Below install CTA | Paints the after-picture. |
| `npm install -g dorkos` | Primary CTA | Presented once, at maximum desire. |

## New Lines to Consider

| Line | Source | Use |
|---|---|---|
| "You slept. They shipped." | Wieden | Sticker-ready. Social bio. Could be primary tagline. |
| "Give your agent a job." | Ogilvy | CTA alternative. Implies the whole product in 5 words. |
| "DorkOS is starting." / "Ready." | Ive | Design language for the boot-sequence experience. |
| "You know how Claude forgets everything? Someone built an OS for that." | Godin | The word-of-mouth sentence. |

## Key Decisions for User

1. **Hero headline:** Long-form (Ogilvy) or short-form (Jobs/Wieden)?
2. **Site feel:** Boot-sequence activation (Ive) or narrative scroll (Jobs/Wieden)?
3. **Primary tagline going forward:** "You slept. They shipped." or "Your AI Never Sleeps" (demoted) or something else?
4. **Module presentation:** Table (Ogilvy) or timeline (Wieden) or gap→fix pairs (Godin)?
