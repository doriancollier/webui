# Round 1: The Big Idea

## Context

You've read the creative brief. You know the product, the audience, the villain, the voice.

Now we need the **concept** — the organizing idea that every page, every section, every line of copy will serve. Not a tagline (that comes from the concept). Not a layout. The idea.

## The Question

**What is the single creative concept that should organize the entire DorkOS website?**

## What We're Looking For

- A concept that unifies the product story (7 modules, one OS), the emotional story (the villain moments → the resolution), and the identity story (built by dorks, for dorks)
- A concept strong enough that every section of the website can be derived from it
- A concept that a developer would remember after closing the tab

## What We Already Have (Use, Challenge, or Replace)

- "Your AI Never Sleeps" — current primary tagline
- "Built by dorks. For dorks. Run by you." — current brand line
- "We solved this for applications fifty years ago. We called it an operating system." — current philosophical anchor
- "One person. Ten agents. Ship around the clock." — current scale story

These exist. You can build on them, remix them, challenge them, or propose something entirely different. Nothing is sacred except the truth of what the product does.

## Your Response Should Include

1. **The Concept** — stated in 1-2 sentences
2. **Why It Works** — your reasoning, in your own voice
3. **How It Plays Out** — 3-5 examples of how this concept would manifest across the site (hero, feature sections, CTA, about page, etc.)
4. **The Line** — if your concept naturally produces a headline or tagline, include it. If not, that's fine — the concept matters more than the line.
5. **What to Kill** — if any existing lines or approaches should be dropped, say so and say why
