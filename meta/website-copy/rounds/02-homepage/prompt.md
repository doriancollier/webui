# Round 2: The Homepage

## The Question

**Write the full homepage copy for DorkOS.** Every section, every headline, every line of body copy. This should be production-ready — something a designer can take and build.

## What You Have to Work With

### The Concept (from Round 1 synthesis)

**The gap between brilliant and broken.** Your AI agents are the most capable developers who ever existed. And they have no schedule, no memory, no way to reach you, and no idea what happened five minutes ago. That's not an intelligence problem. That's a missing operating system.

### Decisions Made

1. **Primary tagline:** "You slept. They shipped." — this is the identity line. Stickers, README, social bios.

2. **Hero headline:** Write BOTH versions — a short-form (punchy, compressed) AND a long-form (builds the absurdity). The user will choose after seeing them in context.

3. **Site feel:** HYBRID — narrative scroll structure (problem -> villain -> product -> install -> tribe) with boot-sequence visual treatment. The story arc drives the sections. But the aesthetic feels like an OS activating. Think: Ive's design language (dark, machined, subsystems activating, monospaced system names, generous whitespace) wrapped around Wieden/Jobs' emotional narrative arc.

4. **Module presentation:** TIMELINE-FIRST with reference table. Lead with Wieden's timeline narrative (11:14pm -> 2:47am -> 7:00am) showing a developer's night. Then provide a compact gap->fix reference below for the architect persona who needs to quickly map what each module does. Story cements the concept. Table satisfies the technical mind.

5. **Language constraint:** NO employment metaphor. The human-agent relationship uses collaborative language: "work with," "teammate," "collaborate," "crew," "build with." The human is the lead — but the tone is warm, not managerial. Think: a builder with a crew, not a boss managing headcount.

6. **AI boldness dimension:** The site speaks to developers who are bold enough to embrace AI agents. Do NOT mock or belittle people who are afraid. Invite them. Make the bold path feel achievable, not exclusive. See the supplemental brief (`brief/ai-boldness-supplement.md`) for data and framing.

### The Site Structure (from Round 1 synthesis)

1. **Hero** — The problem (above the fold). Open with the gap.
2. **The Villain** — Recognition (first scroll). Name the specific pain moments.
3. **The Pivot** — "We solved this for applications fifty years ago. We called it an operating system." (earned mid-page, after emotional setup)
4. **The Product** — Timeline narrative showing a developer's night, then compact module reference
5. **The Install Moment** — `npm install -g dorkos` at maximum desire. Terminal prompt aesthetic.
6. **The Identity Close** — The tribe. "Built by dorks." Not a footer. An invitation.

### Lines Already Placed

| Line | Placement |
|---|---|
| "You slept. They shipped." | Primary tagline. Above or below hero headline. |
| "Your AI Never Sleeps" | Pulse module section header ONLY. Not a primary line. |
| "Built by dorks. For dorks. Run by you." | Identity close. NOT the opener. |
| "We solved this for applications fifty years ago." | Mid-page pivot. Only after emotional setup. |
| "One Person. Ten Agents. Ship Around the Clock." | Below install CTA. |
| `npm install -g dorkos` | Primary CTA. Presented once, at max desire. |
| "DorkOS is starting." / "Ready." | Design language for boot-sequence aesthetic. |
| "Open source. Self-hosted. Yours." | Below install CTA. |

### The Modules

| Module | What it does | The gap it fills |
|---|---|---|
| **Pulse** | Cron-based autonomous execution | No schedule — agents only run when you're watching |
| **Relay** | Built-in messaging + Telegram integration | No communication — agents can't reach you or each other |
| **Mesh** | Agent discovery and network | No colleagues — agents are isolated, no coordination |
| **Wing** | Persistent memory across sessions (coming soon) | No memory — every session starts from zero |
| **Console** | Browser-based command center | No oversight — you're alt-tabbing between terminals |
| **Loop** | Signal -> hypothesis -> dispatch -> measure | No improvement — no feedback loop, no learning |

### Design Language Notes (for your copy to reference)

- The page opens dark. Not decoratively — dark the way a screen is dark before it wakes.
- Each section *activates* as it scrolls into view. Not slides in — switches on.
- Typography is machined: monospaced for system names and code, clean sans-serif for human explanation.
- Generous whitespace = space between components on a board.
- The install command is a terminal prompt with gravity, not a button.
- Status indicators, subtle color shifts from muted to full contrast as sections activate.

## What I Want From You

1. **The full homepage copy** — every section, in order, with headlines, subheads, and body copy.
2. **Design direction notes** — brief notes on visual treatment for each section (what the designer needs to know).
3. **Two hero options** — short-form and long-form. Clearly labeled.
4. **The timeline narrative** for the product section — specific, felt, minute-by-minute.
5. **The module reference** — compact, after the timeline.
6. **The identity section** — the tribal close. Not a bio. An invitation.
7. **One line you'd add** that doesn't exist yet — surprise me.

## What to Avoid

- Employment language (hire, employ, worker, boss, manage headcount)
- "Revolutionary," "game-changing," "unlock potential," "seamlessly"
- Exclamation points
- Cartoon energy
- Overselling Wing (it's "coming soon")
- Faking social proof (pre-launch — design for it but don't fabricate)
- Centering AI as the subject — center the developer and what they can now do
