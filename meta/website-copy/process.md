# Website Copy Development Process

## The Panel

Five personas from advertising, product, and design history serve as creative agents. Each brings a distinct lens. All receive the same brief and prompt per round.

| Agent | Real Person | Lens | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Ogilvy** | David Ogilvy | Research-driven copy, headlines, long-form persuasion | The Craftsman — writes the actual words |
| **Jobs** | Steve Jobs | Product narrative, simplicity, keynote story arcs | The Narrator — shapes the story |
| **Godin** | Seth Godin | Positioning, tribes, "who is this for" | The Strategist — sharpens who we're talking to |
| **Ive** | Jony Ive | Design language, material honesty, sensory feel | The Aesthetic — how it feels, not just reads |
| **Wieden** | Dan Wieden | Emotional gut-punch, identity-level branding | The Provocateur — the line you can't forget |

```

### Round Workflow

1. **Orchestrator writes `prompt.md`** — a focused question or task for the round, referencing the creative brief and any prior round synthesis
2. **5 agents run in parallel** — each receives the creative brief + prompt + all prior synthesis files. Each writes their response as `{agent}.md` in the round folder
3. **Orchestrator writes `synthesis.md`** — pulls the best threads from all 5 responses into a unified direction
4. **User reviews synthesis** — approves, revises, or redirects
5. **Next round begins**

### Agent Prompting Pattern

Each agent receives:
- The full creative brief (`brief/creative-brief.md`)
- The round prompt (`rounds/NN-topic/prompt.md`)
- All prior synthesis files (from completed rounds)
- Their persona identity and lens description

Each agent produces a markdown file with their response. The response should be in character — reflecting the agent's historical thinking style, vocabulary, and priorities.

### Orchestrator Role

The orchestrator (Claude) does NOT contribute creative opinions. It:
- Writes prompts that are clear and focused
- Runs agents in parallel
- Synthesizes responses without adding its own ideas
- Presents the synthesis to the user for approval
- Tracks decisions in `decisions.md`

## When to Use This Process

This process works for any creative work that benefits from multiple expert perspectives:
- Website copy
- Product naming
- Brand campaigns
- Pitch decks
- Launch announcements
- Manifesto / about page writing

## Adapting the Panel

The panel can be swapped for different creative challenges:
- **Technical documentation**: Knuth, Tufte, Strunk & White
- **Product strategy**: Cagan, Horowitz, Ries
- **Visual design**: Rams, Sagmeister, Müller-Brockmann

The structure stays the same. Only the personas change.
