# DorkOS — Brand & Product Foundation

## 1. Executive Summary

**DorkOS** is a professional-grade AI operating layer for developers, founders, and serious builders.

DorkOS is:

- Open source
- Developer-first
- Privacy-respecting
- Modular
- Extremely powerful

It is not a toy.
It is not a chatbot wrapper.
It is a professional AI runtime for people who build.

## 3. Big Idea

You don't use AI. You own it.

DorkOS turns Claude Code into:

- Your remote co-founder
- Your autonomous engineering assistant
- Your personal life infrastructure
- Your private AI runtime

Your machine.
Your models.
Your rules.

---

## 4. Product Architecture

DorkOS is modular and open source. Each module can run independently or together.

### Available now

#### 4.1 DorkOS Core (AI Server)

This is the engine.

#### 4.2 DorkOS Console (Web UI)

## 5. We Believe

- Your AI should run on your machine
- Power tools deserve power users
- Open source is infrastructure, not charity
- Autonomy is a feature, not a risk

DorkOS is:

- Opinionated
- Performance-focused
- Developer-centric
- Built for serious work

---

## 6. What DorkOS Is Not

DorkOS is not a hosted service. Not a model aggregator. Not a chat widget. It's infrastructure you run, own, and control.

---

## 7. Tone & Voice

Confident.
Minimal.
Technical.
Sharp.
Not corporate.

Avoid hype language.

Use language like:

- Runtime
- Infrastructure
- Autonomy
- Permissions
- Control
- Operator
- Builder

### Voice Examples

| Don't say | Say |
|---|---|
| "Easy-to-use AI assistant" | "AI runtime for your machine" |
| "Get started in minutes!" | "Install. Configure. Run." |
| "We help developers..." | "Built for developers who ship." |
| "Powerful AI features" | "Full Claude Code access. Remotely." |
