## Research Summary

World-class developer documentation is characterized by a clear information architecture grounded in the Diátaxis framework (tutorials, how-to guides, reference, explanation), a quickstart that delivers working value in under 5 minutes, interactive API reference powered by OpenAPI, and deliberate design choices that guide users from curiosity to working code with minimal friction. DorkOS currently has a solid structural skeleton but needs substantially more content, richer Fumadocs component usage, and a more opinionated information architecture to reach world-class status.

## Key Findings

### 1. The Diátaxis Framework Is the Gold Standard for IA

The most widely adopted information architecture for developer docs is the **Diátaxis framework**, used by Cloudflare, Gatsby, Django, and others. It defines four distinct documentation modes that serve different user needs:

| Type | User need | Orientation | Answers |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tutorial** | Learning | Practical study | "Help me learn by doing" |
| **How-to guide** | Problem-solving | Goal-oriented | "How do I accomplish X?" |
| **Reference** | Information lookup | Theoretical | "What does X do exactly?" |
| **Explanation** | Understanding | Conceptual | "Why does it work this way?" |

**Critical insight:** These types must be kept strictly separate. Mixing tutorial tone ("now let's try...") into reference material is the single most common failure in developer docs.

### 2. What Makes Stripe's Docs Exceptional — Specific Patterns

Stripe's documentation is cited as the benchmark for the entire industry. The concrete reasons:

1. **Three-column layout** — stable nav left, prose center, live code right. The right column eliminates context switching.
2. **Personalization** — when logged in, API keys are injected into code samples. Copy-paste works immediately.
3. **Language switcher on every code block** — one click to switch all samples between Node, Python, Ruby, Go, PHP, Java simultaneously.
4. **"Happy path first"** — quickstarts document the most common scenario, not every scenario. Advanced cases are behind "see also" links.
5. **Outcome-based naming** — sections are named after what users achieve ("Accept a payment") not what the API does ("Create a PaymentIntent").
6. **No dead ends** — every page ends with "next steps" or "what to do now."
7. **Docs as a product requirement** — features don't ship without complete docs. Documentation is included in performance reviews.

### 3. Supabase Documentation Structure

Supabase's navigation structure is instructive for a multi-product tool:

```
Start          (Getting Started, quickstarts by framework)
Products       (Database, Auth, Storage, Realtime, Edge Functions)
Build          (Development guides, patterns)
Manage         (Platform operations, monitoring)
Reference      (API docs, CLI reference, client libraries)
Resources      (Integrations, migration guides, self-hosting)
```

Key pattern: **the top-level nav reflects user jobs**, not product components. A user managing a deployment goes to "Manage." A user building goes to "Build." This prevents the "which section is this in?" confusion.

### 4. Fumadocs Component Inventory (Full List)

Fumadocs provides significantly more components than the current DorkOS docs use. Full inventory:

#### MDX Components (available in any .mdx file)

**Layout & Structure**
- `<Cards>` / `<Card>` — card grids for navigation and feature showcases
- `<Steps>` / `<Step>` — numbered step sequences with visual connectors (also via `fd-steps`/`fd-step` CSS classes)
- `<Tabs>` / `<Tab>` — tabbed content with `groupId` for synchronized selection across the page/site, `persist` for localStorage persistence, `updateAnchor` for shareable URL-linked tabs
- `<Accordions>` — collapsible FAQ-style sections

**Callouts**
- `<Callout type="info">` — default blue info box
- `<Callout type="warn">` / `<Callout type="warning">` — yellow warning
- `<Callout type="error">` — red error/danger
- `<Callout type="success">` — green success
- `<Callout type="idea">` — purple idea/tip

**Code Features**
- Syntax highlighting via Shiki (all languages)
- `title="filename.ts"` attribute on fences — shows filename header
- `tab="Label"` attribute — creates inline code tab groups (`CodeBlockTabs`)
- `// [!code highlight]` — highlight specific lines
- `// [!code focus]` — dim all lines except focused ones
- `// [!code ++]` / `// [!code --]` — diff highlighting
- Line numbers with configurable start
- **NPM tabs** — `npm install X` auto-generates pnpm/yarn/bun variants
- TypeScript Twoslash — show inferred types inline

**File Trees**
- `<Files>` / `<Folder>` / `<File>` — interactive file tree display
- `Folder` supports `defaultOpen`, `disabled` props
- `remark-mdx-files` plugin — convert ASCII tree syntax or glob patterns

**Type Documentation**
- `<TypeTable>` — manual type documentation table with type/description/default columns
- `<AutoTypeTable>` — auto-generated from TypeScript source files (uses ts-morph)

**Content Reuse**
- `<Include>` — embed content from other MDX files by reference
- `<DocsCategory>` — auto-generates a category page listing child pages from the page tree (excellent for section landing pages)
- `<FeedbackBlock>` — collects user ratings/feedback (integrates with PostHog, GitHub Discussions)

**Media**
- Zoomable images (click to zoom)
- `<Mermaid>` — diagram support (via plugin)

#### OpenAPI Integration (`fumadocs-openapi`)

- Generates full API reference from an `openapi.json` file
- Creates one MDX page per endpoint (or virtual pages)
- Includes interactive API playground ("try it" console)
- Auto-generates code samples in multiple languages
- Auto-generates request parameter tables, response schema tables
- Adds TypeScript type definitions for each response
- Supports OpenAPI 3.0 and 3.1
- Initialize with: `npx fumadocs init openapi`

#### Layout Features

- **Sidebar tabs/dropdowns** — group content into collapsible sections at the root level of the sidebar
- **Collapsible sidebar** — users can hide it on desktop
- **Sidebar banner** — add custom content above navigation items
- `defaultOpenLevel` — control which folder levels auto-expand
- **On-page TOC** — auto-generated from headings, floats right
- **Breadcrumbs** — auto-generated from page tree hierarchy
- **Git last-modified timestamps** — shows when page was last updated
- **Built-in search** — via Orama (default) or Algolia/Mixedbread/Trieve
- **FeedbackBlock** — per-page satisfaction rating

#### Heading Features

- Custom anchors: `## My Heading [#custom-slug]`
- Hide from TOC: `## Internal Note [!toc]`
- Show only in TOC (not inline): `## Section Break [toc]`

### 5. Information Architecture for DorkOS

Based on the Diátaxis framework and patterns from Stripe/Supabase/Tailwind, here is a recommended top-level IA for DorkOS:

```
docs/
├── (no prefix — landing page)       Home / Overview
├── getting-started/
│   ├── installation.mdx             Install (npm, or Obsidian)
│   ├── quickstart.mdx               First 5 minutes (CLI path)
│   └── configuration.mdx           All config options
├── guides/                          HOW-TO GUIDES (task-oriented)
│   ├── cli-usage.mdx                CLI flags, subcommands, workflows
│   ├── obsidian-plugin.mdx          Obsidian-specific guide
│   ├── tool-approval.mdx            Managing tool approval flows
│   ├── slash-commands.mdx           Creating and using slash commands
│   ├── keyboard-shortcuts.mdx       Keyboard reference

├── self-hosting/                    HOW-TO (deployment)
│   ├── deployment.mdx
│   └── reverse-proxy.mdx
├── api/                             REFERENCE (auto-generated)
│   └── (OpenAPI-generated pages)
├── integrations/                    REFERENCE + HOW-TO
│   ├── building-integrations.mdx
│   └── sse-protocol.mdx
└── contributing/                    INTERNAL AUDIENCE
    ├── development-setup.mdx
    ├── architecture.mdx
    └── testing.mdx
```

**Key change:** Add a `concepts/` section to house explanatory content (currently buried in `contributing/`). Split `contributing/architecture.mdx` into user-facing concepts and contributor-facing architecture.

### 6. Quickstart Best Practices

Research consensus on what a great quickstart contains:

1. **Time to value under 5 minutes** — measure and optimize ruthlessly
2. **Single success moment** — the quickstart has exactly one goal; it ends when that goal is achieved
3. **Prerequisites upfront with links** — don't let users fail at step 3 because of a missing prerequisite
4. **Show the output** — include a screenshot or terminal output showing what success looks like
5. **Numbered steps, not prose** — use `<Steps>` component, not paragraphs
6. **One command, one result** — each step does exactly one thing
7. **Never ends with "Done!"** — always ends with "What to try next" links
8. **Separate quickstarts per persona** — a CLI quickstart differs from an Obsidian plugin quickstart

**Current DorkOS quickstart assessment:** The existing quickstart is a stub (5 bullet points, no steps component, no code blocks, no output screenshot, no "next steps"). It reads like internal notes, not a user guide.

**Recommended structure for DorkOS quickstart:**

```
1. Prerequisites (Node 20+, API key) — with callout if missing
2. Install (npm install -g dorkos) — with NPM tabs
3. Configure (export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...) — with callout about persistence
4. Launch (dorkos) — code block + expected output
5. First message — screenshot of interface
6. What happened? — brief 3-sentence explanation
7. Next steps — cards linking to: CLI options, Obsidian plugin, Tool approval, Configuration
```

### 7. API Reference Documentation Patterns

Best practices for API reference (highly relevant for DorkOS's REST/SSE API):

**Structure per endpoint:**
- HTTP method badge + path (e.g., `POST /api/sessions/:id/messages`)
- One-sentence description
- Authentication requirements
- Path parameters table (name, type, required, description)
- Query parameters table
- Request body schema (with TypeTable or auto-generated from OpenAPI)
- Response schema (all status codes: 200, 400, 409, 422, 500)
- Code examples in multiple languages
- "Try it" interactive console

**OpenAPI-first approach:** DorkOS already generates `openapi.json` via `npm run docs:export-api`. The `fumadocs-openapi` integration should be the primary driver for the `docs/api/` section rather than hand-written MDX files. The current hand-written MDX files in `docs/api/api/` should be replaced with Fumadocs OpenAPI auto-generation.

**SSE endpoints need special treatment:** Standard OpenAPI doesn't model SSE well. The SSE streaming protocol deserves its own dedicated explanation page (which DorkOS already has in `docs/integrations/sse-protocol.mdx`) with annotated event payload examples.

**Error documentation:** Every error code should be documented with:
- When it occurs
- What the response body looks like
- How to resolve it

### 8. CLI Documentation Conventions

Based on research from clig.dev and industry patterns:

**Structure for CLI docs:**

```
## Overview
Brief 1-2 sentence description of what the CLI does and why.

## Installation
(link to main installation page)

## Commands

### dorkos [options]
Main command description.

**Options:**
| Flag | Short | Default | Description |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| --port | -p | 4242 | Port to run the server on |
| --dir | -d | cwd | Working directory |
| --boundary | -b | $HOME | Filesystem boundary |
| --tunnel | -t | false | Enable ngrok tunnel |

### dorkos config
Manage configuration.

### dorkos init
Interactive setup wizard.

## Configuration Precedence
CLI flags > environment variables > ~/.dork/config.json > built-in defaults

## Common Workflows
(Show the top 3-5 real-world usage patterns with complete commands)

## Environment Variables
Table of all env vars with names, descriptions, defaults
```

**Conventions:**
- Use `<angle-brackets>` for required arguments
- Use `[square-brackets]` for optional arguments
- Show the exact error message when showing error scenarios
- Include `--help` output formatted as a code block
- Provide a "cheatsheet" or quick reference card

### 9. Handling Multiple Deployment Targets

DorkOS has four distinct deployment targets: npm CLI, Obsidian plugin, self-hosted server, and web app (standalone). Best practices for docs covering multiple targets:

**Pattern 1: Separate quickstarts per installation path**
Recommended. Each target gets its own Getting Started flow:
- "Install via npm" (most users)
- "Install Obsidian Plugin" (Obsidian users)
- "Self-host the server" (infrastructure users)

Use a `<Cards>` component on the installation page to let users choose their path immediately. This is what Supabase does (quickstarts by framework).

**Pattern 2: Tabs for target-specific content within shared pages**
Use `<Tabs groupId="install-target" persist>` with tabs like "npm CLI | Obsidian Plugin | Self-hosted" on configuration pages where the options differ by target. The `groupId + persist` combo ensures once a user picks their target, all tabs on all pages remember the choice.

**Pattern 3: Callouts for target-specific warnings**
Within shared guide pages, use `<Callout type="info">` with clear labeling:
```
<Callout type="info">**Obsidian plugin note:** The working directory is determined
by your vault location and cannot be changed via --dir flag.</Callout>
```

**Pattern 4: Target-specific guide pages**
`docs/guides/obsidian-plugin.mdx` is the right approach — a dedicated guide per target for anything more complex than a short callout.

## Detailed Analysis

### What "World Class" Looks Like in Practice

Reviewing Stripe, Vercel/Next.js, Supabase, and Tailwind CSS docs reveals a set of qualities that consistently appear:

**1. The "30-second test"**
Within 30 seconds of landing on the docs, a developer should be able to answer: (a) what is this? (b) is it for me? (c) how do I start? DorkOS's current index page passes (a) and (b) but provides no quick signal for (c) beyond a link list. A hero section with a 2-sentence value proposition and a single prominent CTA ("Install in 30 seconds") would fix this.

**2. Progressive disclosure**
World-class docs reveal complexity progressively. The index page shows nothing complex. The quickstart shows just enough to succeed. The guides add depth. The reference is exhaustive. Each page links to the next level of detail, never dumps everything on the reader at once.

**3. Copy-paste-runnable everything**
Every code block should work when pasted into a terminal or editor without modification. This means: complete import statements, no placeholder values without instructions for how to replace them, real command names not pseudocode.

**4. Visual hierarchy that reflects conceptual hierarchy**
Tailwind CSS docs use a clear typographic scale. H2 = major section. H3 = subsection. H4 = specific item. Callouts draw attention to important warnings without competing with the main flow. Code blocks break visual monotony.

**5. The "aha moment" is engineered**
Great docs engineer the moment when the user's code works for the first time. Everything before that moment is friction to eliminate. Everything after that moment is optional depth.

### Fumadocs-Specific Recommendations

Given DorkOS already uses Fumadocs, here is what should be adopted immediately:

**Use `<Steps>` on every procedural guide** — the current quickstart and installation pages use numbered lists (1. 2. 3.) instead of the Steps component. Steps provide visual connectors, better spacing, and clearer progression.

**Use `<Cards>` on the index and section landing pages** — replace link lists with card grids. Each card should have an icon, title, and 1-sentence description. Fumadocs Cards are composable inside DocsCategory for auto-generated category pages.

**Use `<Tabs groupId="package-manager" persist>` for all install commands** — Fumadocs actually has built-in NPM tab generation. A code block written as:
```bash
npm install -g dorkos
```
...can automatically generate pnpm/yarn/bun variants with a single config option.

**Use `<Callout>` for all warnings, notes, and tips** — currently the docs have inline bold text for warnings. Callouts are visually distinct and scannable.

**Use `<TypeTable>` for configuration reference** — the configuration page currently lists options as prose. A TypeTable with columns for name, type, default, and description is far more scannable.

**Use the OpenAPI integration for `docs/api/`** — the current approach of hand-writing one MDX file per endpoint is fragile and will drift from the actual API. Replace with `fumadocs-openapi` and the generated spec from `npm run docs:export-api`.

**Add `<FeedbackBlock>` to high-traffic pages** — a thumbs-up/thumbs-down widget at the bottom of key pages provides direct signal about what's working.

**Use `<DocsCategory>` for section landing pages** — instead of a manually maintained list of links, `<DocsCategory>` auto-generates a card grid from the page tree. This means adding new pages automatically appears in the section index.

**Use `<Include>` for shared content** — any content that appears in multiple places (like the prerequisites block or the API key setup) should live in a single `.mdx` file and be `<Include>`d elsewhere. This prevents drift.

### Information Architecture Gaps in Current DorkOS Docs

**Missing: A concepts/explanation layer**
The current structure jumps from "how to use" guides directly to "contributing" architecture docs. There's no middle layer explaining *why* things work the way they do for users who want to understand the system without contributing to it. Examples:
- "Why does DorkOS show sessions I created in the CLI?" (session model explanation)
- "What is a Transport and why does it matter?" (for users building integrations)
- "How does tool approval work under the hood?" (for power users)

**Missing: A proper home page**
The `docs/index.mdx` is essentially a table of contents. World-class docs index pages are mini landing pages: hero with value prop, "who is this for" section, 2-3 key feature cards, then the navigation.

**Missing: A changelog with visual design**
The `docs/changelog.mdx` exists but is presumably empty or minimal. Changelogs are high-traffic pages and should use a timeline-style layout with version headings, type badges (Breaking, Feature, Fix), and clear dates.

**Thin content in high-value pages**
- `cli-usage.mdx` — is a TODO stub
- `building-integrations.mdx` — is a TODO stub
- `quickstart.mdx` — is 10 lines with no code
- `tunnel-setup.mdx` — not examined but likely thin

These are the pages developers will search for most. They must be prioritized.

---

## Actionable Recommendations (Priority Order)

### Immediate (content > structure)

1. **Rewrite the quickstart** — Use `<Steps>`, add real code blocks with expected output, end with next-step `<Cards>`. Target: developer gets Claude responding in 5 minutes.

2. **Write cli-usage.mdx** — Full flags table (`<TypeTable>`), subcommands reference, common workflows section with complete copy-paste examples.

3. **Upgrade installation.mdx** — Add target-selection `<Cards>` at the top (npm / Obsidian / self-hosted). Add NPM package manager tabs. Add a "verify installation" step with expected output.

4. **Upgrade the index page** — Add hero text, "Who is this for?" section, feature cards, then the navigation list.

### Short-term (architecture improvements)

5. **Add `concepts/` section** — Move architecture content from `contributing/` to user-facing `concepts/` pages. Write session model, transport interface, and tool approval explanations.

6. **Wire up Fumadocs OpenAPI** — Replace hand-written `docs/api/api/**/*.mdx` with `fumadocs-openapi` auto-generation from the existing `openapi.json`. Add the interactive playground.

7. **Apply component upgrades across all pages:**
   - `<Steps>` on all procedural content
   - `<Callout>` for all notes/warnings
   - `<TypeTable>` on all config reference tables
   - `<DocsCategory>` on all section landing pages

8. **Add multi-target tabs** — Use `<Tabs groupId="install-target" persist>` on configuration page for npm/Obsidian/self-hosted differences.

### Medium-term (polish)

9. **Write the changelog** — Use a consistent format. Consider generating from git tags or release notes.

10. **Add FeedbackBlock to all major pages** — Track which docs pages have poor satisfaction scores.

11. **Add a self-hosting guide** — `deployment.mdx` and `reverse-proxy.mdx` exist; write them with full step-by-step examples (Docker, Railway, Fly.io, bare VPS).

12. **Write integrations guides** — `building-integrations.mdx` is the page custom client authors will search for first. It should include a complete working example of a custom Transport implementation.

## Research Gaps & Limitations

- Did not examine Tailwind CSS v4 docs structure in depth (site is accessible but research focused on others)
- Could not access the Fumadocs Auto Type Table page directly — confirmed it exists and integrates with ts-morph for TypeScript source file parsing
- Fumadocs v14 changelog page was inaccessible — v14 features (component cloning, etc.) were confirmed via secondary sources
- Multi-deployment-target documentation patterns research returned irrelevant results; conclusions are synthesized from first principles and observed patterns at Supabase
