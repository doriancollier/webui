## Research Summary

This report synthesizes best practices for building polished, professional graph/topology visualization UIs, covering 8 domains: level-of-detail zoom rendering, edge label design, drag-to-connect UX, empty state onboarding, minimap navigation, node grouping, accessibility, and color/visual hierarchy. The patterns draw from production tools (Figma, Railway, n8n, React Flow) and academic graph visualization research.

---

## Key Findings

1. **Level of Detail (LOD) is the single highest-leverage rendering technique** — progressive information disclosure at zoom levels is what separates toy graph UIs from professional tools.
2. **Edge labels are the most commonly botched visual element** — rotation-to-follow-edge and "over" placement dramatically reduce clutter.
3. **Drag-to-connect requires three distinct visual states** — idle handle, hover/connecting affordance, valid/invalid connection state — each must be visually distinct.
4. **Empty states should be pre-populated or heavily scaffolded** — blank canvases with no guidance cause abandonment; ghost/demo data performs significantly better.
5. **Minimaps need to be interactive, not just indicative** — click-to-navigate is table stakes; dragging the viewport rectangle is the gold standard.
6. **Node grouping must support expand/collapse at the cluster level** — static groups create more cognitive load than they save.
7. **Accessibility in graph UIs is genuinely hard and systematically skipped** — keyboard traversal through nodes, ARIA roles for edges, and screen reader alternatives are all achievable but require upfront design.
8. **Color should encode exactly one semantic dimension per node** — status, type, or health. Never all three simultaneously.

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Level of Detail (LOD) — Node Cards at Different Zoom Levels

#### The Core Principle

The fundamental insight from yWorks and graph visualization research is: **render only what is readable at the current zoom level**. Every pixel of unreadable text is wasted rendering budget and cognitive noise.

#### The Four-Stage LOD Ladder

This is the canonical LOD progression used by professional graph tools:

| Zoom Level | What to Show |
|---|---|
| Very far out (< 20%) | Node as colored dot or minimal shape only. No text at all. Size encodes degree or weight. |
| Far out (20–50%) | Node shape + type icon. Maybe a 1-2 word label if it fits at ≥8px. Edges as thin lines. No edge labels. |
| Mid zoom (50–100%) | Full node card with title. Possibly subtitle. Edge labels appear if they fit. |
| Close zoom (100%+) | Full node card with all metadata fields, badges, status indicators. Edge labels fully visible. Connection handles appear on hover. |

#### Node Aggregation at Scale

At very low zoom, individual nodes should collapse into **cluster nodes** — a single representative shape whose area/size encodes the count of aggregated nodes. This is the "level of detail filtering" approach (yWorks calls it diagram restructuring). The key visual pattern:

- Cluster node shows a count badge ("14 nodes")
- Cluster node's color reflects the dominant type inside
- Click or zoom to expand — the transition should be animated (nodes fly out from the cluster centroid)

#### Implementation Notes (React Flow context)

The `@gravity-ui/graph` library demonstrates a clean pattern: it **automatically switches between Canvas rendering (low zoom) and HTML/React component rendering (high zoom)**. At low zoom, Canvas handles thousands of nodes efficiently. At high zoom, HTML components handle rich interactive node cards. The zoom threshold crossover is typically around 0.4–0.6 transform scale.

For React Flow specifically, this means:
- Use `useViewport()` to get current zoom level
- Conditionally render simplified vs full node content based on zoom
- Use `visibility: hidden` (not `display: none`) on elements you want hidden at low zoom, so React Flow can still measure them

#### Text Rendering Thresholds

Research from Neo4j's D3 work sets a practical rule: **suppress any text that would render below 8px effective pixel height**. This means a 12px font should disappear when zoom is below `8/12 = 0.67`. Cache this calculation as a derived value rather than computing per-render.

---

### 2. Edge Label Best Practices

#### The Three Label Decisions

Every edge label involves three independent choices:

**A. Rotation**
Always rotate labels to follow the edge direction. Horizontal labels across diagonal edges create a "label soup" anti-pattern — the eye can't disambiguate which label belongs to which edge. Rotation-to-follow-edge removes this ambiguity entirely.

Exception: short (1-2 character) labels on nearly-horizontal edges can stay horizontal.

**B. Placement Region**
- **"Over" (within the edge stroke):** Best for dense graphs. The edge path curves around the label, creating a white space "bubble" that creates breathing room and makes association unambiguous.
- **"Above/below":** Creates label overlap problems in dense graphs but looks cleaner in sparse ones.
- **Source/Target association:** For directed graphs, placing the label near the source makes the "from" semantics clear; near the target makes the "to" semantics clear. Use this when the direction is the primary information.

**C. Visibility Threshold**
Edge labels should be **hidden until zoom level ≥ 70%** as a default. At lower zoom, they contribute noise without readability. Use the same pixel-height threshold as node text.

#### Truncation Strategy

For edge labels in constrained space:
1. Truncate at a fixed character count (e.g., 15 chars) + ellipsis
2. Show full label in a tooltip on hover
3. Never wrap edge labels to multiple lines — it distorts the edge path rendering

#### Label Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Labels that repeat information visible from the edge's color coding
- Labels on every edge when most are the same type (better: label only the exceptions)
- Labels that overlap node cards — use `z-index` or route labels to clear node bounding boxes

### 3. Drag-to-Connect UX Patterns

#### The Three Required Visual States

A drag-to-connect interaction requires three distinct states, each needing explicit visual design:

**State 1: Idle (no interaction)**
Connection handles (ports) are **hidden or very subtle** by default. Showing all handles at all times clutters node cards, especially when nodes have multiple in/out ports. The standard pattern: handles are invisible at rest, with a subtle hover affordance (e.g., a faint circle at 15% opacity) that confirms "this is connectable."

**State 2: Hover affordance**
When the user hovers a node while dragging a connection, OR hovers a node normally, handles become **fully visible** with a solid circle/dot at the port position. The color should be your brand accent color. Size increase (e.g., 8px → 12px) on hover provides additional affordance.

React Flow's built-in classes for this:
```css
.react-flow__handle:hover {
  /* full handle visibility */
}
.react-flow__handle.connecting {
  /* connection line is above this handle */
}
.react-flow__handle.valid {
  /* proposed connection passes validation */
  background: var(--color-success);
}
```

**State 3: Valid/Invalid connection feedback**
While dragging, **every potential target handle** on every valid target node should show a **green "accept" ring** or **red "reject" ring** based on type compatibility. This is the most important feedback mechanism — without it, users don't know where they can connect until they try.

Invalid connection handles should use `background: var(--color-destructive)` + a slightly pulsing animation to signal "this won't work."

#### Ghost Edge / Temporary Edge Pattern

React Flow's "temporary edges" example shows the gold standard pattern:
- When a user drops a connection in empty space (not on a handle), render a **ghost/temporary node** at the drop point with a dotted edge connecting to the source
- The ghost node shows a creation affordance (e.g., "+" icon or "What comes next?" prompt)
- This gracefully handles the common case of "I wanted to create a new node and connect it"

#### Connection Line Style During Drag

The connection line (ghost edge while dragging) should be:
- Dashed or animated (marching ants) to distinguish from real edges
- Same color as the source handle
- Uses a curved bezier path matching your default edge style, not a straight line — this previews the actual layout

#### "Easy Connect" Pattern

React Flow's "Easy Connect" example shows a simplified pattern for beginners: when hovering any node, show a **floating "+" connector ring** around the entire node perimeter, not specific port handles. Clicking anywhere on the ring starts a connection. This lowers the precision requirement and works well for tools where connection direction doesn't matter.

### 4. Empty State & Onboarding UX for Graph Canvases

#### The Blank Canvas Problem

A graph canvas with no nodes is one of the most intimidating empty states in UI design. Unlike a blank text editor, users have no affordance — they don't know where to click, what to drag, or how to begin. Abandonment rates on blank canvases are high.

#### The Four Empty State Strategies (ranked best to worst)

**1. Pre-populated demo graph (best)**
Show a real or synthetic example graph immediately. n8n does this with a "starter workflow" template. Railway shows a demo service graph. The user can delete and start fresh, but they first experience the value proposition. The cognitive load is inverted: instead of "how do I start," it becomes "how do I modify this."

**2. Interactive onboarding overlay**
A guided overlay that walks the user through: "Click here to add your first node → Now connect it to this node → Great, you've built a graph." Use a spotlight/backdrop to focus attention. Provide skip at every step. The Carbon Design System documents this as the "first-use empty state" pattern.

**3. Contextual callout with a single CTA**
If a pre-populated graph isn't appropriate (blank slate tools), use a centered illustration + headline + single action button. Follow the rule: "two parts instruction, one part delight." The illustration should visualize what the graph will look like when populated, not an abstract art piece.

**4. Hint text on hover regions (worst but common)**
Showing "Drag here to add a node" in the canvas only when hovering is better than nothing but fails for first-time users who don't know where to hover.

#### Ghost Node Patterns

For canvases where users have added one node but no connections yet, show **ghost/shadow nodes** connected with dashed edges suggesting "what could come next" based on the node type. These are not functional — they're visual scaffolding that prompts the user to connect and expand. Clicking a ghost node converts it to a real node.

#### First-Run Detection

Distinguish between:
- **True first-run** (never used the product): Show full onboarding overlay
- **First session with a new project** (experienced user, new blank project): Show only the "+ Add Node" CTA with a subtle callout, not the full tutorial

### 5. Minimap Patterns for Graph Navigation

#### Core Minimap Requirements

A graph minimap has two functions: **orientation** (where am I in the overall graph?) and **navigation** (how do I get somewhere specific?). Both must be solved.

**Minimum viable minimap:**
- Fixed position, corner-mounted (bottom-right is conventional)
- Scaled down representation of all nodes (as color-coded dots or simplified shapes)
- Viewport rectangle overlay showing current view extent
- Click anywhere in minimap to jump the viewport to that position

**Gold standard minimap:**
- Draggable viewport rectangle (drag the rectangle to pan the main canvas)
- Minimap itself is pannable/zoomable when the graph is very large
- Node colors in minimap match main canvas node colors (semantic color coding)
- Highlighted selection state — selected nodes appear brighter in minimap
- Collapsible — a small toggle button to hide/show for users who want maximum canvas space

#### Minimap Rendering Performance

For large graphs (1000+ nodes), rendering every node in the minimap is expensive. Solutions:
1. Use `canvas.toDataURL()` to snapshot the current canvas and scale it down
2. Render only nodes as simple colored rectangles (skip all text, icons, complex shapes)
3. Throttle minimap re-renders to once per 200ms during panning/zooming

#### AntV X6 Minimap Pattern

AntV X6's minimap feature replaces nodes with customizable solid color blocks. This is the right call — at minimap scale (typically 10-15% of canvas size), node detail is meaningless. What matters is cluster positions and densities.

#### React Flow MiniMap Component

React Flow ships a `<MiniMap>` component with:
- `nodeColor` callback for per-node color
- `nodeStrokeColor` for node borders
- `maskColor` for the out-of-viewport overlay tint
- Click-to-navigate built in
- `pannable` and `zoomable` props for the gold-standard interaction

The viewport indicator in the minimap is styled via `.react-flow__minimap-viewport` CSS class.

### 6. Node Grouping / Clustering Visual Patterns

#### The Expand/Collapse Group Pattern

Groups (clusters, swimlanes, combos) must be **expand/collapse interactive**, not static containers. Static groups that don't collapse add visual weight without reducing complexity. The interaction model:

- **Collapsed:** Group shown as a single summary node with count badge ("5 services"), dominant color of contained nodes, summary label
- **Expanded:** Group shown as a rounded rectangle container with all child nodes rendered inside, a resize handle, a collapse button in the top corner
- **Transition:** Animate the expand/collapse — child nodes fly out from or collapse into the centroid. 200–300ms with an ease-out curve.

#### Visual Design for Group Containers

- Use a low-opacity fill (5-10% opacity of the group's accent color) to create the container region without creating a heavy visual block
- Border should be a 1-2px dashed or solid line in the accent color at higher opacity (40-60%)
- Group label should be in the top-left, smaller and lighter weight than node labels
- Drop shadow on the container creates depth and makes the group feel "selectable" as a unit

#### Nested Group Hierarchy

Cambridge Intelligence's "combos" pattern supports multiple nesting levels. The visual trick: **each nesting level gets progressively lighter fill opacity**. Level 1 at 10%, Level 2 at 7%, Level 3 at 4%. This ensures readability regardless of how deep the nesting goes.

**Aggregated edge pattern:** When a group is collapsed, replace all inter-group edges with a **single aggregated edge** that shows a count badge ("8 connections"). On hover of the aggregated edge, show a tooltip listing the individual connections. This is the primary mechanism that makes collapsed groups useful.

#### Swimlane Pattern

For linear/pipeline topologies (like n8n workflows or CI/CD stages), swimlanes are more appropriate than freeform groups:
- Horizontal bands with labels on the left rail
- Nodes are constrained to their lane (can't be dragged out)
- Lane headers can be collapsed to hide all content in that stage
- Color coding per lane (different hue for each stage/owner)

### 7. Accessibility for Graph UIs

#### The Fundamental Challenge

Graph visualizations present a genuine accessibility problem: the spatial relationships ARE the data. A screen reader describing "node A is to the left of node B" is meaningless — what matters is "node A is connected to node B with an edge labeled 'depends on'."

#### Required Accessibility Patterns

**Keyboard navigation:**
- `Tab` moves focus between nodes (not through every interactive element on the canvas first)
- `Arrow keys` navigate between connected nodes (following edges)
- `Enter` or `Space` to expand/select a node and open its detail panel
- `Escape` to deselect and return focus to canvas container
- `Ctrl+A` to select all
- `Delete` to remove selected nodes/edges

**ARIA roles and labels:**
- Canvas container: `role="application"` with `aria-label="[Graph Name] — use arrow keys to navigate"`
- Individual nodes: `role="button"` or custom `role="treeitem"` for hierarchical graphs
- Edge connections: Described via `aria-describedby` linking the node to a hidden text description of its connections
- For fully accessible implementations: provide an accompanying accessible data table as an alternative view of the same data

**Screen reader strategy (two approaches):**

1. **Full accessibility path:** Implement proper ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, and semantic edge descriptions. Hard but achievable. Cambridge Intelligence's KeyLines library demonstrates this.

2. **Pragmatic fallback:** Apply `aria-hidden="true"` to the canvas element, and provide a separate accessible view (a sortable table of nodes + connections) that screen reader users can use instead. This is more achievable and still WCAG-compliant if the alternative provides equivalent information.

**Color accessibility:**
- Never use color as the ONLY means of conveying status — always pair with an icon or shape
- Run all palettes through colorblind simulators (deuteranopia is most common — red/green confusion)
- Achieve minimum 3:1 contrast ratio for node labels against their background (WCAG AA for UI components)
- Prefer colorblind-safe palettes: ColorBrewer's qualitative palettes, or IBM's colorblind-safe palette

**Motion safety:**
- Animated edges (marching ants, pulsing highlights) must respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Provide a settings toggle to disable all canvas animations
- Any flashing/pulsing effects must comply with WCAG 2.3.1 (< 3 flashes per second)

### 8. Color Coding & Visual Hierarchy in Node-Link Diagrams

#### The One-Dimension Rule

The most common color mistake in graph UIs is **overloading color with multiple semantic dimensions** — using the same color both to indicate node type AND health status. This forces users to do mental cross-referencing to understand what any given color means.

The rule: **color encodes exactly one semantic dimension at a time.** If you need to show both type and status, use color for type and a separate icon/badge for status.

#### Semantic Color Palette for Nodes

Standard semantic layers used by production tools (n8n, Railway, Datadog topology maps):

| Color | Semantic Use |
|---|---|
| Neutral gray | Idle / inactive / disabled node |
| Blue | Active / running / nominal |
| Green | Success / healthy / completed |
| Yellow/amber | Warning / degraded / pending |
| Red/rose | Error / critical / failing |
| Purple | Processing / in-flight / loading |
| Distinct hues per type | Service type, owner, category (use sparingly, max 7-8 hues before the palette becomes unreadable) |

#### Node-to-Background Contrast

Research from Cambridge Intelligence and graph visualization literature establishes:
- Node fill color against canvas background: minimum 3:1 contrast ratio
- Node label text against node fill: minimum 4.5:1 (WCAG AA)
- Edge lines against canvas background: minimum 3:1

For dark-theme canvases (common in infrastructure tools), use slightly desaturated/shifted hues — full-saturation colors on dark backgrounds create intense halation that makes edges look like halos.

#### Edge Color Strategy

Edge color should be:
- **Same neutral gray as canvas border** as the default (edges should not compete with nodes for attention)
- **Animated/highlighted** when the user hovers a connected node
- **Color-coded by edge type** only when edge type is a primary data dimension (e.g., "depends on" vs "triggers" vs "blocks")

Research shows that **complementary-colored links enhance the discriminability of node colors** — if your nodes are warm hues, use cool-hued edges. Avoid using a hue similar to your dominant node color for edges.

#### Visual Weight Hierarchy

The canonical visual weight order for graph elements (most to least prominent):

1. **Selected node** — strongest visual weight (bright fill + drop shadow + accent ring)
2. **Hovered node** — elevated fill + subtle shadow
3. **Active/error nodes** — semantic color fill
4. **Normal nodes** — neutral fill with clear border
5. **Selected edges** — higher opacity + slightly thicker stroke
6. **Normal edges** — low opacity (40-60%) thin lines
7. **Edge labels** — smaller, lighter weight than node labels
8. **Group containers** — lightest visual weight (low opacity fills, dashed borders)
9. **Grid/snap guides** — dashed lines, lowest opacity possible while still visible

#### Typography in Graph Cards

- Node title: 13-14px, semibold (500-600 weight), neutral foreground
- Node subtitle/metadata: 11-12px, regular weight, muted foreground (60% opacity)
- Edge labels: 10-11px, regular weight, muted foreground
- Group labels: 11-12px, medium weight, matches group accent color
- Status badges: 10px, semibold, semantic color background with contrasting text

**Font choice matters:** Sans-serif is required for all graph text. Monospace works well for technical identifiers (IDs, URLs, version strings). Never use serif in graph UIs.

## Pattern Summary — What Makes a Graph UI Feel Polished

The following micro-patterns are what separate "functional" from "polished":

1. **Smooth zoom transitions** — cubic-ease curves on zoom, not linear. Pan and zoom should feel like butter, not snap.
2. **Node entrance animations** — new nodes fly in from their creation point with a 150ms scale-up. Removed nodes shrink and fade (not disappear).
3. **Edge routing that avoids node overlap** — straight edges that pass through nodes look broken. Use bezier curves or orthogonal routing.
4. **Selection box (rubber-band select)** — click-drag on empty canvas should draw a selection rectangle. This is expected by power users.
5. **Cmd+Z undo on all canvas actions** — drag, connect, delete, group must all be undoable.
6. **Zoom-to-selection** — selecting nodes and pressing a keyboard shortcut (or double-clicking the zoom control) should fit the selection in view.
7. **Connection preview on hover** — when hovering a node while any connection tool is active, show a faint dotted line from the node to the cursor.
8. **Smart edge bundling** — multiple edges between the same two nodes should be bundled/stacked, not overlapping exactly.
9. **Context menu on right-click** — right-clicking a node/edge should show contextual actions, not the browser context menu.
10. **Auto-layout on demand** — a single "auto-layout" button that tidies the graph. Users want manual control but love having an escape hatch.

## Research Gaps & Limitations

- Direct analysis of Railway.app's topology UI internals was not accessible (would require product access)
- Figma's canvas LOD implementation details are proprietary (documented at high level in their engineering blog)
- n8n's node UI design guide page content was not retrievable; patterns were inferred from the live product and community discussion
- Minimap drag-to-pan implementation specifics for React Flow required inference from library source code patterns

---

## Contradictions & Disputes

- **LOD thresholds:** yWorks recommends showing labels at < 70% zoom "if readable"; Neo4j's D3 research uses a hard 8px pixel-height cutoff. Both are valid but the pixel-height approach is more precise.
- **Handle visibility:** Some tools (Miro, Figma) show connection handles only on hover; others (Lucidchart, draw.io) show them persistently. For dense graphs, hover-only is clearly better. For sparse graphs with few connections, persistent handles reduce discoverability complaints.
- **Pre-populated empty states vs blank canvas:** Some power users (developers, especially) actively prefer a blank canvas — pre-populated graphs feel presumptuous. Consider a toggle: "Start with example" vs "Start blank."
