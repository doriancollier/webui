## Research Summary

Developer tool landing pages in 2025-2026 converge on a tight, research-backed formula: minimal copy, centered hero, immediate credibility signal, product-in-action demo, curated social proof. The Jobs/Godin/Ogilvy frameworks translate cleanly to this space when applied correctly — Jobs gives you the "one thing" clarity and theatrical reveal structure, Godin gives you the identity/tribe framing that makes developers feel seen and recruited rather than sold to, and Ogilvy gives you the discipline to back every claim with a specific fact. DorkOS has a rare positioning advantage: it occupies a category ("remote access to Claude Code, no cloud") that is currently uncrowded and resonates with the surging "local-first" software movement.

## Key Findings

### 1. The Evil Martians Study: What Actually Works Across 100+ Dev Tool Pages

Evil Martians' Head of Design analyzed 100+ successful dev tool landing pages (including Linear, Supabase, Vercel, and others) and found two rules applied to nearly every top performer:

- **No salesy BS.** Developers have finely-tuned BS detectors. Superlatives, adjective-heavy copy, and vague promises ("powerful," "seamless," "next-generation") actively repel the audience.
- **Clever and simple wins.** Most top pages avoid flashy interactions. Clean typography, clear layout, breathing room. The design serves the copy; the copy earns its place.

**Section structure found across top performers (in order):**
1. Nav (logo + docs + GitHub + CTA)
2. Hero (centered, headline + sub + CTA + product screenshot or terminal demo)
3. Clients/social proof bar (immediately after hero — "one of the fastest ways to build credibility")
4. Problem/Why section (real user problems, not feature lists)
5. How it works / Feature breakdown (specific, concrete, one idea per section)
6. Curated testimonials (styled as tweets or GitHub comments but manually chosen — no auto-embeds)
7. Pricing or Open Source CTA
8. Final CTA block

**On social proof:** Nearly all pages use curated testimonials. Even when styled to look like a tweet, they're hand-picked and controlled. For tools without enterprise logos, big concrete numbers work: GitHub stars, install counts, weekly npm downloads.

**On testimonials:** They're aligned with the page's key message — not random praise. Each testimonial reinforces a specific claim made elsewhere on the page.

### 2. Real Homepage Copy from Leading Dev Tools

**Railway:** "Ship software peacefully" / "With the all-in-one intelligent cloud provider"
- Primary CTAs: "Deploy →" and "Demo"
- Note: The headline is emotional, not functional. "Peacefully" is the word doing the work.
- Section structure: Hero → Build → Network → Scale → Monitor → Evolve → Testimonials → Community (2M+ developers) → Stats

**Supabase:** "Build in a weekend / Scale to millions"
- Subhead: "Supabase is the Postgres development platform."
- Credibility: 97.7K GitHub stars, Top 100 GitHub repos, SOC2 Type 2, HIPAA
- Logo bar: Mozilla, GitHub, 1Password, PWC
- Note: The headline is a promise of transformation, not a description of the product. Supabase is named in the first sentence of the subhead — not buried.

**Cursor:** "Built to make you extraordinarily productive, Cursor is the best way to code with AI."
- Primary CTAs: "Download for macOS ⤓" and "Try mobile agent →"
- Section structure: Hero → Logo garden (Stripe, OpenAI, Linear, Figma, NVIDIA) → Feature highlights → Multi-platform showcase → Testimonials → Model selection → Codebase indexing → Enterprise → Blog → Footer
- Note: Cursor leads with the outcome ("extraordinarily productive"), names competitors indirectly through their logo garden (these are customers who chose Cursor over alternatives).

**Warp:** "Warp: The Agentic Development Environment"
- Dark theme (#121212), "Matter" and "Inter" fonts
- Positions itself in a category ("agentic development environment") rather than describing features

**Linear:** "The system for product development"
- Noted for: sparse design, conversational headline copy, subtle motion showing the tool in action, "copy reads like a Slack message — human and fast"
- Repeating CTAs keep decision friction low

---

### 3. Jobs Principles Applied to a CLI Tool

Steve Jobs never sold a product by describing it. He sold it by:

**Naming a category and owning it.** The iPod wasn't "a portable music player with 5GB storage." It was "1,000 songs in your pocket." The category was personal and emotional. The spec was proof, not the pitch.

For DorkOS: "Remote access to Claude Code from any browser" is the category claim. "One npm install. Runs on your machine. No cloud. No middleman." are the proof-points. The order matters — category first, proof second.

**The Rule of Three.** Jobs always structured reveals in threes. For DorkOS hero: three bullets, three proof points, three features in the "How it works" section. Never four.

**The antagonist.** Jobs' best presentations had a villain (the status quo, the incumbents). For DorkOS, the villain isn't a competitor by name — it's the cloud dependency model itself. "Every AI interface you've tried lives in someone else's cloud. DorkOS doesn't." The villain is the pattern, not a product.

**The "holy smokes" moment.** One thing on the page that earns a reaction. For DorkOS, this is likely the terminal demo: watch `npx dorkos` spin up a full AI session you can access from your phone. Show it. The moment when someone realizes "wait, this is running on my MacBook and I'm using it from my iPad" is the product's strongest asset.

**Simplicity as philosophy.** Jobs' products radically simplified. The homepage should embody this. No feature matrices. No bullet lists of 12 things. If you need 12 bullets to explain value, you haven't found your one thing yet.

---

### 4. Godin Principles: Tribe/Movement Framing for Open Source

Seth Godin's core insight: "People like us do things like this."

Successful tribe-building for a developer tool means making the visitor feel that using DorkOS is an identity statement, not just a tool choice. The developer who chooses DorkOS is making a statement about what they believe:

- They believe AI should be on their hardware, not rented from someone else's
- They believe in open source as infrastructure, not as a charity project
- They believe in owning their tools the way craftspeople own their instruments
- They believe autonomy isn't a feature, it's a right

**Tribal copy signals (vs. generic copy):**

| Generic | Tribal |
|---|---|
| "Powerful AI workflow tool" | "Your AI. Your machine. Your rules." |
| "Open source AI interface" | "Infrastructure, not SaaS" |
| "Works with Claude Code" | "Claude Code, unchained from the terminal" |
| "Privacy-focused" | "No cloud. No middleman. No one watching." |

**The "not for you" move.** Godin says the most powerful tribe-building copy explicitly excludes people. This builds conviction for the right audience. DorkOS's "What DorkOS is not" section is this move — and it should be explicit on the page, not buried in docs. "DorkOS is not for people who want someone else to manage their AI infrastructure. It's for developers who want to own it."

**Evangelism architecture.** Give developers something to say. A badge on their GitHub README. A shareable install command. A Hacker News comment they can write that sounds like insight, not a sales pitch. The product needs a quotable sentence. "Own Your AI" is close. "Your AI, on your hardware" might be sharper.

**Open source as credibility, not charity.** Supabase handles this masterfully: they show GitHub stars and note "Top 100 GitHub repos" as a trust signal. For DorkOS, open source isn't a selling point (everyone says they're open source) — it's proof of the philosophy. "Read every line of code that touches your AI sessions" is more powerful than "we're open source."

---

### 5. Ogilvy Principles: Concrete Copy Craft

Ogilvy's most famous headline: "At 60 miles an hour, the loudest noise in this new Rolls-Royce comes from the electric clock."

That headline works because:
1. It's specific (60 mph, not "high speed")
2. It's concrete (electric clock, not "quiet interior")
3. It's earned through research (Ogilvy read everything about the car for 3 weeks before writing a word)
4. It implies a claim without making it ("the loudest noise is the clock" implies extraordinary quietness without saying "quiet")

**Applied to DorkOS:**

Bad headline (Ogilvy would reject): "A powerful AI development environment that gives you control."

Good headline (Ogilvy-style): "One npm install. Claude Code in your browser. Running on your machine."

The difference: the good version is falsifiable, specific, and implies the larger claim (control, ownership) through concrete facts rather than adjectives.

**Ogilvy's rules most applicable to DorkOS:**

1. **The headline is 80 cents of every dollar.** If the DorkOS hero headline isn't doing the job alone, the page isn't working. Test multiple options relentlessly.

2. **Specificity is believability.** "Runs in 30 seconds" beats "quick setup." "Zero cloud dependencies" beats "privacy-first." "You own the JSONL transcript files" beats "your data stays with you."

3. **Long copy works for interested buyers.** Developers read. A technical "How DorkOS works" section with real code and architecture explanation will outperform a vague features grid for the audience DorkOS is targeting.

4. **Research first.** Ogilvy spent 3 weeks studying the Rolls-Royce before writing. The DorkOS page needs to be built from actual developer pain: what do developers actually hate about cloud AI interfaces? What's the exact moment they wish they had something different? That's the headline.

5. **Avoid vague adjectives.** Ban from the DorkOS page: "powerful," "seamless," "robust," "next-gen," "cutting-edge," "innovative." Replace each with a specific claim or delete.

## Detailed Analysis

### Section 1: Hero — Recommended Structure for DorkOS

The research consensus is: **centered layout, single big claim, one supporting sentence, one or two CTAs, product visual below the fold.**

For DorkOS specifically, the hero structure should be:

```
[Tagline badge — optional: "v1.0 now available" or "Open Source"]

HEADLINE (h1):
Own Your AI.

SUBHEAD (1-2 sentences max):
DorkOS gives you remote access to Claude Code from any browser.
One npm install. Runs on your machine. No cloud. No middleman.

CTA PRIMARY: npx dorkos  [copyable terminal command]
CTA SECONDARY: Read the docs →  or  View on GitHub →

BELOW THE FOLD: Terminal/browser screenshot showing Claude Code session
```

**On the CTA choice (npm install command vs button):**
The research shows npm install commands as CTAs work specifically for developer-targeted tools because:
- It proves the product exists (you can run this right now)
- It demonstrates simplicity (one command)
- It's a conversion in itself — copy → paste → done
- Anime.js uses exactly this pattern: `npm i animejs` as the CTA with a GitHub link secondary

The Evil Martians research recommends having two CTAs: one for immediate conversion (install command), one for exploration (docs or GitHub). This maps to how Cursor does it: "Download for macOS ⤓" + "Try mobile agent →" — primary is immediate action, secondary is softer exploration.

**What not to do in the hero:**
- Don't list features (save that for section 3+)
- Don't use a button that says "Get Started" (meaningless to a developer)
- Don't include screenshots of settings panels or config UIs — show the result (a working session in a browser)
- Don't explain what Claude Code is (your audience knows)
- Don't use the word "powerful"

---

### Section 2: Credibility Signal (immediately after hero)

For DorkOS at early stage without a large customer logo wall, the options in priority order:

1. **GitHub stars** — Show the count. Even 100 stars from real developers is a signal. Update it dynamically.
2. **npm weekly downloads** — A concrete, verifiable number.
3. **"Built on Claude Agent SDK"** — Anthropic's own SDK as a credibility anchor. This is "powered by" credibility without being a hollow endorsement.
4. **Tech stack logos** — Not "integrations" but "built with": Node.js, Claude SDK, TypeScript. This is credibility for the technical buyer who will inspect your stack before installing.
5. **Quotes from HN/Reddit threads** — If DorkOS has been discussed positively in real developer communities, a pulled quote (styled as a comment) is powerful. "This is exactly what I've been wanting" from a named HN commenter beats a generic testimonial.

**What the Evil Martians research confirms:** For solo dev tools without enterprise logos, stars + usage stats + awards replace the logo bar. Don't fake the logo bar with generic company logos — it reads as desperation and technically-literate visitors will notice.

---

### Section 3: The "Why" / Differentiation Section

**Do not name competitors.** The positioning should describe the category you reject, not the products you compete with.

Structure that works:

```
The wrong way to run AI.
[3-column comparison of the pattern, not specific products]

Every AI interface you've used lives in someone else's cloud.
Their servers. Their logs. Their pricing. Their uptime.

DorkOS is different.
[3 concrete bullets about what's different]
```

Alternatively, the "What DorkOS is not" move is strong as a standalone section if written with conviction (not as a defensive disclaimer). This is Godin's "not for you" move. Frame it as the product having standards:

```
DorkOS is not a hosted service.
DorkOS is not a model aggregator.
DorkOS is not a chat widget.

It's a runtime. It runs on your machine, and it gives you
a browser interface to the Claude Code sessions you start yourself.
```

---

### Section 4: How It Works

This section must be concrete and specific. The target audience will evaluate whether to install DorkOS partly by understanding the architecture. They want to know: what runs where, what data touches what, how sessions persist.

**Recommended format:** Three steps, each with a terminal snippet or screenshot.

```
1. Install
   npx dorkos --dir ~/projects
   [Terminal screenshot of startup]

2. Open
   Your browser. Any device. The interface is live at localhost:4242.
   Remote access via tunnel with one flag: --tunnel
   [Browser screenshot showing Claude Code chat]

3. Work
   Full Claude Code. Tool approvals. Session history. Slash commands.
   JSONL transcripts stored locally. Always.
   [Screenshot of tool approval flow or session sidebar]
```

**The "how it works" section is where the Ogilvy specificity rule matters most.** Numbers, port numbers, file paths, command flags — these are not jargon, they are proof. They demonstrate the product exists and has been built with care. "Stored at ~/.claude/projects/" is more trustworthy than "saved locally."

---

### Section 5: Terminal/Code Demo Strategy

**The research consensus: animated terminal demos work well for developer tools, but only when they show a real workflow, not a contrived "hello world."**

For DorkOS, the ideal demo is:
- Shows the install command running
- Shows the server starting up (port binding message)
- Cuts to a browser showing a Claude Code session in progress
- Maybe shows the tunnel URL being generated

Tools: `termynal` (GitHub: ines/termynal) is a lightweight, accessible library for terminal animations that degrades gracefully for non-JS visitors.

**Placement:** Below the hero, or as the visual element in the "How it works" section. Not both — pick one location for the animated demo.

**The Jobs "holy smokes" moment** lives in this demo. The moment that earns a reaction is: "I'm accessing Claude Code in a browser, on my phone, and it's running on my laptop." If the demo shows that in 10 seconds, it sells the product. If the demo shows a config file, it doesn't.

---

### Section 6: Social Proof — Early-Stage Strategy

**The research finding:** GitHub star counts have limited impact on download numbers alone (a field experiment found no discernible effect from inflated stars on package downloads). Stars matter for perceived credibility among technical evaluators, not as a direct conversion mechanism.

**More effective social proof for DorkOS at early stage:**

1. **Specific developer testimonials** — "I've wanted this exact thing for 6 months" is more powerful than "Great tool!" Find the developers who have already said something like this in DMs, Issues, or social media. Ask for a quote. Display it.

2. **The "built with" stack** — Listing the underlying technologies (Claude Agent SDK, TypeScript, Express, Vite) signals engineering rigor to the technical evaluator.

3. **Contributor count** — If DorkOS has contributors beyond the core team, show the faces. Even 3-5 contributors signals that others have invested trust in the project.

4. **GitHub activity** — Not just stars, but commits-this-week, open issues being closed, PRs being merged. Dynamic activity signals a living project.

5. **"Featured in" or "Discussed in"** — If DorkOS has appeared in any newsletter, blog post, or podcast, that's a credibility signal. Even a Hacker News thread counts.

**What to avoid:** The fake logo bar. Do not place company logos on the page unless those companies are actually using DorkOS. Technical audiences will notice the mismatch immediately.

---

### Section 7: Shipped vs. Roadmap

**The research finding:** Technical audiences value transparency over polish. A clear distinction between what's live and what's coming builds more trust than presenting everything as if it exists.

**Best practice for early-stage open source tools:**
- Never list roadmap features as if they exist
- Do show a public roadmap linked from the page (GitHub Projects or a simple `/roadmap` page)
- On the marketing page itself, use a "What's live" section with a subtle "Coming soon" callout — not a full roadmap table
- Frame the roadmap as invitation: "Here's what's next. Star the repo to follow along."

**Framing that works (Supabase-style):** Supabase ships public changelogs ("Supabase Launch Week") that turn shipped features into marketing events. For DorkOS, this could be: every significant shipped feature gets its own GitHub Release with a short changelog — and those releases are referenced on the marketing page as proof of velocity.

---

### Section 8: Open Source Positioning

The local-first software movement (Ink & Switch, lofi.so) has articulated the philosophical position clearly: "You own your data, in spite of the cloud."

DorkOS fits squarely in this tradition and can borrow from its language. The seven ideals of local-first software map directly:

| Local-First Ideal | DorkOS Expression |
|---|---|
| No spinners | Sessions start locally, no round-trips to Anthropic servers for DorkOS itself |
| Multi-device access | Access your Claude Code session from phone, tablet, another machine |
| Optional networks | Claude Code runs without DorkOS being connected to any external service |
| Security by default | JSONL transcripts stay on your machine, behind your firewall |
| Ultimate user control | You start the session, you approve the tools, you own the files |

"Own Your AI" as a tagline maps cleanly onto "You own your data, in spite of the cloud." DorkOS is the local-first answer to cloud-hosted AI interfaces.

**Positioning statement that synthesizes this:**
"Every AI development interface lives in someone else's cloud. DorkOS runs on yours. One npm install gives you a browser interface to Claude Code sessions that live entirely on your machine — your hardware, your transcripts, your rules."

---

## Copy Principles Summary

### Headline Formula Options

Option A (Jobs-style, category claim):
"Own Your AI."
[Simple. Declarative. Identity statement.]

Option B (Ogilvy-style, specific fact as implied claim):
"One npm install. Claude Code in your browser. Stored on your machine."
[No adjectives. Pure fact. The claim is implied, not stated.]

Option C (Godin-style, tribe marker):
"Built for developers who don't rent their tools."
[Exclusionary. Polarizing. Appeals to the right identity.]

Option D (Railway-style, emotional outcome):
"Claude Code, anywhere. Without giving up control."
[Short. Two competing desires resolved.]

**Recommendation:** Use Option A ("Own Your AI.") as the h1, then Option B as the immediate subhead. The combination delivers Jobs' category clarity with Ogilvy's specificity.

### Words to Ban from the DorkOS Page
- powerful
- seamless
- robust
- next-generation
- cutting-edge
- innovative
- intuitive
- comprehensive
- enterprise-grade (unless targeting enterprise)
- revolutionary

### Words to Use Instead
- runs on your machine
- your transcripts, your files
- one command
- no cloud
- open source (with star count as proof)
- tool approvals (specific feature name)
- JSONL (specific, technical, credible)
- Claude Agent SDK (named technology = credibility)
- localhost:4242 (specific port = proof of realness)
- ~/.claude/projects/ (specific file path = proof of local storage)

---

## Research Gaps & Limitations

- The Evil Martians study article body was not extractable (JavaScript-rendered). Summaries from search snippets and their public template (LaunchKit) were used instead.
- No direct A/B test data was available comparing npm-install CTAs vs button CTAs for open source CLI tools
- DorkOS has no publicly available analytics or user data to benchmark against
- Linear's homepage copy was not extractable due to JavaScript rendering; positioning was inferred from secondary sources

---

## Contradictions & Disputes

**On "how much technical detail in the hero":**
- Ogilvy tradition says: more specific is more credible, include technical details
- Modern landing page conventional wisdom says: hero should be simple, save details for below the fold
- Resolution: the hero should have ONE specific technical claim ("runs on your machine," "one npm install") but not multiple. The Ogilvy specificity applies to the details throughout the page, not to cramming the hero with specs.

**On open source as a selling point:**
- Some research suggests "open source" is commoditized as a claim — everyone says it
- Counter-evidence: Supabase uses "97.7K GitHub stars" and "Top 100 GitHub repos" as major credibility signals, suggesting that for developer audiences, open source credibility still matters — but must be shown, not just stated
- Resolution: Don't say "we're open source." Show it: star count, contributor count, GitHub link, readable code.

**On social proof format:**
- Generic testimonials ("Great tool!") have low conversion impact
- Specific, technically-relevant testimonials ("Finally, Claude Code accessible from my iPad without forwarding ports") have high impact
- The Evil Martians research confirms this: curated, aligned testimonials only. Never auto-pulled reviews.
