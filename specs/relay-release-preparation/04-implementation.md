- `docs:export-api` script fails with module resolution error (pre-existing) — no API endpoints changed

## Implementation Notes

### Session 1

All 9 tasks completed in 5 parallel batches:
- Batch 1 (1 task): Foundation config changes
- Batch 2 (3 tasks parallel): Concept pages, project files, blog post
- Batch 3 (3 tasks parallel): 6 user guides
- Batch 4 (1 task): Integration doc updates
