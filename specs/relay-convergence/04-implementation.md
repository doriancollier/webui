## Implementation Notes

### Execution Strategy
- 9 batches with parallel agents per batch
- Dependency-aware ordering: schemas → storage → services → wiring → client → docs
- Total: 55 new tests added, all passing

### Key Design Decisions
- TraceStore shares SQLite database with Relay SqliteIndex (`~/.dork/relay/index.db`)
- MessageReceiver uses table existence check (not user_version) for migration since it shares the DB
- SQL SUM returns null for empty tables — coalesced with `?? 0` for DeliveryMetrics
- `useChatSession` hoists streamEventHandler to hook level via useMemo so it's shared between legacy SSE and Relay EventSource paths
- clientIdRef (crypto.randomUUID) is stable per tab via useRef
