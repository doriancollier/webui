# Relay, Mesh & Telegram Adapter — Code Review Remediation Round 2

**Slug:** relay-mesh-telegram-review-fixes-r2
**Author:** Claude Code
**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Branch:** N/A (applies to main)
**Related:** Follows spec #73 (relay-mesh-telegram-review-fixes)

---

## 1) Intent & Assumptions

- **Task brief:** Fix all critical and important issues found in a second-round code review of the Relay subsystem, Mesh topology UI, and Telegram adapter. This review was conducted against the codebase AFTER spec #73 was implemented, and found new issues — including bugs introduced by the spec #73 implementation itself (reconnection logic).
- **Assumptions:**
  - All 6 critical and 10 important issues will be addressed
  - 7 suggestion-severity issues are explicitly out of scope
  - The `Transport` interface will be extended with `updateConfig()` to fix the Obsidian plugin breakage
  - The duplicate dispatch (DeliveryPipeline + WatcherManager) will be fixed by skipping watchers for pipeline-dispatched messages
- **Out of scope:**
  - Outbound message splitting for Telegram (suggestion — product decision)
  - Caption test path for Telegram (suggestion — test gap)
  - Zod/interface type drift assertion (suggestion — compile-time nicety)
  - `BindingDialog` state reset on reopen (suggestion — minor UX)
  - Pulse schedule basename heuristic (suggestion — edge case)
  - `enrichAgent` redundant health query (suggestion — perf, defer to DB consolidation spec)
  - `MeshStatsHeader` error state handling (suggestion — minor UX)

## 2) Pre-reading Log

- `packages/relay/src/adapters/telegram-adapter.ts`: Reconnection logic (added in spec #73) leaks old bot instances and doesn't track the setTimeout timer. Webhook server has error handler leak and can't shut down keep-alive connections. `extractChatId` accepts floats.
- `packages/relay/src/delivery-pipeline.ts:153-154`: Synchronous dispatch to subscribers happens here, but `WatcherManager` also watches the same `new/` directory — both attempt to claim the same message.
- `packages/relay/src/watcher-manager.ts:100-128`: Chokidar watcher fires `handleNewMessage()` which races with `DeliveryPipeline.dispatchToSubscribers()`.
- `apps/server/src/services/relay/binding-store.ts:182-205`: `skipNextReload` boolean flag has a race condition when two saves overlap — wrong chokidar event consumes the flag.
- `apps/server/src/routes/relay.ts:377-444`: Three adapter routes use `as` casts instead of Zod validation on `req.body`.
- `apps/server/src/routes/relay.ts:303-337`: SSE stream writes to `res` without checking `writableEnded`.
- `apps/server/src/services/relay/binding-router.ts:247-256`: `loadSessionMap` silently accepts malformed JSON shapes.
- `apps/client/src/layers/entities/mesh/model/use-mesh-scan-roots.ts:27-33`: Raw `fetch('/api/config')` bypasses Transport interface — breaks Obsidian plugin.
- `packages/mesh/src/mesh-core.ts:212-221, 276-281`: Incomplete compensating transaction — when Relay registration fails, manifest file is not cleaned up.
- `apps/client/src/layers/features/mesh/ui/CrossNamespaceEdge.tsx:56-60`: Dead SVG animation — `mpath xlinkHref` references non-existent path ID.
- `apps/client/src/layers/features/mesh/ui/TopologyGraph.tsx:524-545`: `handleNodeClick` includes `layoutedNodes` in deps, recreating callback on every drag.
- `apps/client/src/layers/features/mesh/ui/TopologyGraph.tsx`: Topology refetch (15s) triggers ELK layout recomputation even when data hasn't changed.
- `packages/shared/src/transport.ts`: Transport interface missing `updateConfig()` method — needed for scan roots fix.

## 3) Codebase Map

**Primary Components/Modules:**

- `packages/relay/src/adapters/telegram-adapter.ts` — Telegram adapter with polling/webhook modes, reconnection logic
- `packages/relay/src/delivery-pipeline.ts` — Maildir endpoint delivery with backpressure and circuit breaker
- `packages/relay/src/watcher-manager.ts` — Chokidar watcher lifecycle for maildir endpoints
- `apps/server/src/services/relay/binding-store.ts` — JSON file-backed adapter-agent binding store with hot-reload
- `apps/server/src/services/relay/binding-router.ts` — Central routing for adapter-agent bindings
- `apps/server/src/routes/relay.ts` — HTTP route handlers for relay API
- `packages/mesh/src/mesh-core.ts` — Mesh agent registration with compensating transactions
- `apps/client/src/layers/entities/mesh/model/use-mesh-scan-roots.ts` — Scan roots management hook
- `apps/client/src/layers/features/mesh/ui/TopologyGraph.tsx` — ELK topology visualization
- `apps/client/src/layers/features/mesh/ui/CrossNamespaceEdge.tsx` — Cross-namespace edge component
- `packages/shared/src/transport.ts` — Transport interface contract

**Shared Dependencies:**

- `packages/shared/src/transport.ts` — Transport interface (needs `updateConfig()`)
- `packages/shared/src/relay-schemas.ts` — Zod schemas for adapter routes
- `apps/client/src/layers/shared/lib/transports/http-transport.ts` — HTTP transport adapter
- `packages/shared/src/manifest.ts` — `removeManifest()` for compensation fix

**Data Flow:**

- Inbound Telegram message → `handleInboundMessage()` → `onMessage` callback → Relay publish → `DeliveryPipeline.deliverToEndpoint()` → `dispatchToSubscribers()` (+ `WatcherManager` race)
- Config update: UI → `useMeshScanRoots` → raw fetch (broken) → should use Transport → PATCH /api/config

**Potential Blast Radius:**

- Direct: 11 files need changes
- Transport interface change affects: `HttpTransport`, `DirectTransport`, `TransportProvider` (if any)
- Tests: ~6 test files need new/updated tests

## 4) Root Cause Analysis

N/A — this is a remediation pass, not a single bug fix.

## 5) Research

No external research needed. All issues have clear fixes based on established patterns already used elsewhere in the codebase (atomic saves, timer tracking, Zod validation, Transport interface, generation counters).

## 6) Decisions

| # | Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Transport interface for scan roots fix | Add `updateConfig()` to Transport | The Obsidian plugin uses `DirectTransport` which has no `fetch`. Raw `fetch` is a Transport bypass that breaks the hexagonal architecture. Both adapters need the new method. |
| 2 | Duplicate dispatch fix approach | Skip watchers for pipeline-dispatched endpoints | Mark messages dispatched by `DeliveryPipeline` so `WatcherManager` skips them. Preserves watcher support for external writes while preventing double-fire. `claim()` atomicity already prevents data corruption, but handler side effects may not be idempotent. |
| 3 | Issue scope | Critical + Important only (16 issues) | Covers all bugs, races, leaks, and validation gaps. Suggestions are deferred to keep blast radius manageable. |
