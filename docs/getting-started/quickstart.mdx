# Quickstart

This guide takes you from installation to your first Claude Code conversation through the DorkOS web interface.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Node.js 18+** installed
- **Claude Code CLI** installed and authenticated (`claude` must be available in your PATH)
- **DorkOS** installed globally via `npm install -g dorkos`

<Callout type="info">
  Need help with installation? See the [Installation guide](/docs/getting-started/installation) for detailed setup instructions.
</Callout>

## Launch DorkOS

<Steps>

<Step>
### Start the server

Open a terminal, navigate to your project directory, and run:

```bash
dorkos
```

DorkOS starts on port **4242** by default and opens the web interface in your browser.

```
  DorkOS v1.x.x
  Local:   http://localhost:4242 // [!code highlight]
  Network: http://192.168.1.100:4242
```

To use a different port or project directory:

```bash
dorkos --port 8080 --dir ~/projects/myapp
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Send your first message

Type a message in the chat input at the bottom of the screen and press **Enter**. Claude will begin streaming its response in real time.

Try something like:

```
Explain the structure of this project
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Approve tool calls

When Claude needs to read files, run commands, or make edits, it will request permission through a tool approval card. Review what Claude wants to do, then click **Approve** or **Deny**.

<Callout type="warn">
  Tool approval is a safety mechanism. Always review tool calls before approving, especially for write operations and shell commands.
</Callout>

</Step>

</Steps>

## Explore the Interface

<Tabs items={["Sessions", "Slash Commands", "Working Directory"]}>

<Tab value="Sessions">
The **sidebar** lists all your conversation sessions. Sessions are stored as SDK transcript files, so conversations started from any Claude Code client (CLI, DorkOS, Obsidian) all appear here.

- Click a session to switch to it
- Click **New Session** to start a fresh conversation
- Session history persists across restarts
</Tab>

<Tab value="Slash Commands">
Type `/` in the chat input to open the **command palette**. Slash commands are loaded from `.claude/commands/` in your working directory and can inject predefined prompts or workflows.
</Tab>

<Tab value="Working Directory">
DorkOS operates in a working directory, just like the Claude Code CLI. By default it uses the directory where you launched `dorkos`. Use the **directory picker** in the sidebar to switch directories without restarting.
</Tab>

</Tabs>
