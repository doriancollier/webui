description: Install DorkOS as an npm CLI, Obsidian plugin, or self-hosted server
---

# Installation

DorkOS runs in three modes: as a standalone **npm CLI**, as an **Obsidian plugin**, or as a **self-hosted** development server. Pick the one that fits your workflow.

## Prerequisites

<Callout type="info">
  All installation methods require [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20 or later and a Claude API key from the [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/).
</Callout>

## Choose Your Install Method

<Tabs items={['npm CLI', 'Obsidian Plugin', 'Self-Hosted']}>

<Tab value="npm CLI">

The fastest way to get started. Install the `dorkos` package globally and run it from any directory.

<Steps>
<Step>

### Install the package

```bash tab="npm"
npm install -g dorkos
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm add -g dorkos
```

```bash tab="yarn"
yarn global add dorkos
```

```bash tab="bun"
bun add -g dorkos
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Set your API key

DorkOS needs your Anthropic API key to communicate with Claude:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

To persist this, add it to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.).

</Step>
<Step>

### Verify the installation

```bash
dorkos --version
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Start DorkOS

```bash
dorkos
```

The server starts on port 4242 and opens your browser automatically. Visit [http://localhost:4242](http://localhost:4242) to see the interface.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
  You can pass flags to customize startup: `dorkos --port 8080 --dir ~/projects/my-app`. Run `dorkos --help` for all options.
</Callout>

</Tab>

<Tab value="Obsidian Plugin">

Run DorkOS directly inside [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as a sidebar panel, with full access to your vault files.

<Steps>
<Step>

### Open Obsidian settings

Go to **Settings** then **Community Plugins** and make sure community plugins are enabled.

</Step>
<Step>

### Search for DorkOS

Click **Browse** and search for **DorkOS** in the community plugin directory.

</Step>
<Step>

### Install and enable

Click **Install**, then toggle the plugin on. DorkOS appears as a sidebar view.

</Step>
<Step>

### Configure your API key

Open the DorkOS plugin settings and enter your Anthropic API key.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warn">
  The Obsidian plugin requires Node.js 20+ installed on your system. It uses the same Claude Agent SDK as the CLI but runs in-process via the DirectTransport adapter.
</Callout>

</Tab>

<Tab value="Self-Hosted">

Clone the repository and run the full development stack. Useful for contributing or customizing DorkOS.

<Steps>
<Step>

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dork-labs/dorkos.git
cd dorkos
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Install dependencies

```bash tab="npm"
npm install
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm install
```

```bash tab="yarn"
yarn install
```

```bash tab="bun"
bun install
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Configure environment

Create a `.env` file in the repository root:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts both the Express API server and Vite dev server. The interface is available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with hot module replacement.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
  For production builds, run `npm run build` then `npm start` to serve the compiled app on port 4242.
