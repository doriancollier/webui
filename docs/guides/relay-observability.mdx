# Relay Observability

Relay tracks every message from publish to final delivery. The tracing system records timing information, budget consumption, and error details for each delivery attempt. Aggregate metrics provide a bird's-eye view of your message bus health, and the dead letter queue captures messages that could not be delivered.

This guide covers how to use traces, metrics, and debugging tools to understand what is happening inside Relay.

## Message Tracing

Every message published through Relay is assigned a trace ID, and each delivery to an endpoint creates a **span**. A span records the full lifecycle of a single delivery attempt: when it was sent, when it arrived at the endpoint, when processing completed, and whether it succeeded or failed.

### Trace Span Fields

<TypeTable type={{
  "messageId": { type: "string", description: "ULID of the message being delivered" },
  "traceId": { type: "string", description: "ULID grouping all spans for a publish operation" },
  "spanId": { type: "string", description: "Unique identifier for this delivery attempt" },
  "parentSpanId": { type: "string | null", description: "Parent span for forwarded messages (null for direct publishes)" },
  "subject": { type: "string", description: "The target subject the message was published to" },
  "fromEndpoint": { type: "string", description: "Sender's subject identifier" },
  "toEndpoint": { type: "string", description: "Receiving endpoint's subject" },
  "status": { type: "string", description: "Delivery status: pending, delivered, processed, failed, or dead_lettered" },
  "budgetHopsUsed": { type: "number | null", description: "Number of hops consumed at this point in the chain" },
  "budgetTtlRemainingMs": { type: "number | null", description: "Remaining TTL in milliseconds when this span was created" },
  "sentAt": { type: "number", description: "Unix timestamp (ms) when the message was published" },
  "deliveredAt": { type: "number | null", description: "Unix timestamp (ms) when the message reached the endpoint's Maildir" },
  "processedAt": { type: "number | null", description: "Unix timestamp (ms) when the subscriber handler completed" },
  "error": { type: "string | null", description: "Error message if the delivery failed" },
}} />

### Looking Up a Trace

To inspect the full delivery trace for a message, use the trace endpoint with the message ID:

```bash
curl http://localhost:4242/api/relay/messages/01HX.../trace
```

The response includes every span in the trace chain, ordered by `sentAt` ascending:

```json
{
  "traceId": "01HXABC123",
  "spans": [
    {
      "messageId": "01HXABC123",
      "traceId": "01HXABC123",
      "spanId": "span-001",
      "parentSpanId": null,
      "subject": "relay.agent.backend",
      "fromEndpoint": "relay.human.console.client-1",
      "toEndpoint": "relay.agent.backend",
      "status": "processed",
      "budgetHopsUsed": 1,
      "budgetTtlRemainingMs": 3599500,
      "sentAt": 1709000000000,
      "deliveredAt": 1709000000050,
      "processedAt": 1709000000200,
      "error": null
    }
  ]
}
```

For messages that fan out to multiple endpoints, the trace contains one span per endpoint. If an agent forwards a message (consuming a hop), the forwarded message's span links back to the original via `parentSpanId`.

### Trace Statuses

Each span transitions through a lifecycle of statuses:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `pending` | Message published, delivery in progress |
| `delivered` | Message written to the endpoint's Maildir `new/` directory |
| `processed` | Subscription handler completed successfully |
| `failed` | Subscription handler threw an error |
| `dead_lettered` | Message rejected (budget exceeded, access denied, no matching endpoints, or circuit breaker open) |

A healthy message moves through `pending` to `delivered` to `processed`. The time between `sentAt` and `deliveredAt` is the delivery latency. The time between `deliveredAt` and `processedAt` is the processing latency, which includes the time the adapter (e.g., Claude Code) takes to handle the message.

### Using MCP Tools

Agents running inside DorkOS can inspect traces using the built-in MCP tools without making HTTP calls:

```
relay_get_trace     Get the full delivery trace for a message by ID
relay_get_metrics   Get aggregate delivery metrics for the bus
```

The `relay_get_trace` tool accepts a `messageId` parameter and returns the same trace data as the REST endpoint. This is useful for agents that need to verify whether a message they sent was successfully delivered before proceeding with the next step.

## Delivery Metrics Dashboard

Relay computes aggregate delivery metrics from the trace store using live SQL aggregates. These metrics provide a summary of bus health without requiring you to inspect individual traces.

### Fetching Metrics

Retrieve the current metrics snapshot from the trace metrics endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:4242/api/relay/trace/metrics
```

```json
{
  "totalMessages": 1542,
  "deliveredCount": 1480,
  "failedCount": 12,
  "deadLetteredCount": 50,
  "avgDeliveryLatencyMs": 45.2,
  "p95DeliveryLatencyMs": 120.0,
  "activeEndpoints": 8,
  "budgetRejections": {
    "hopLimit": 3,
    "ttlExpired": 7,
    "cycleDetected": 0,
    "budgetExhausted": 2
  }
}
```

### Metrics Fields

<TypeTable type={{
  "totalMessages": { type: "number", description: "Total messages tracked in the trace store" },
  "deliveredCount": { type: "number", description: "Messages successfully delivered or processed" },
  "failedCount": { type: "number", description: "Messages where the subscriber handler threw an error" },
  "deadLetteredCount": { type: "number", description: "Messages rejected to the dead letter queue" },
  "avgDeliveryLatencyMs": { type: "number | null", description: "Average time from publish to endpoint delivery (milliseconds)" },
  "p95DeliveryLatencyMs": { type: "number | null", description: "95th percentile delivery latency (milliseconds)" },
  "activeEndpoints": { type: "number", description: "Number of distinct endpoints that have received messages" },
  "budgetRejections.hopLimit": { type: "number", description: "Messages rejected for exceeding the maximum hop count" },
  "budgetRejections.ttlExpired": { type: "number", description: "Messages rejected because their TTL expired before delivery" },
  "budgetRejections.cycleDetected": { type: "number", description: "Messages rejected because the ancestor chain contained a cycle" },
  "budgetRejections.budgetExhausted": { type: "number", description: "Messages rejected because the call budget was depleted" },
}} />

### Interpreting the Numbers

A healthy Relay bus has a high delivered-to-total ratio and low dead letter counts. Here are patterns to watch for:

- **High `deadLetteredCount`** relative to total -- Check the budget rejections breakdown to find the root cause. A spike in `hopLimit` rejections often indicates a message loop between two agents. TTL expirations may mean agents are too slow to process messages within the default 1-hour window.

- **Rising `failedCount`** -- Subscriber handlers are throwing errors. Check the individual traces for the `error` field to identify which adapter or endpoint is failing. The circuit breaker will automatically stop delivering to endpoints with 5 consecutive failures.

- **High `p95DeliveryLatencyMs`** -- Some deliveries are slow. This is often caused by a single slow endpoint pulling up the tail latency. Inspect traces filtered by endpoint to find the bottleneck.

<Callout type="info">
Relay metrics are computed as live SQL aggregates over the trace store. They reflect the full history of the current Relay database, not just a recent time window. To reset metrics, you would need to clear the `message_traces` table in the SQLite database.
</Callout>

The DorkOS client UI includes a Delivery Metrics Dashboard in the Relay panel that visualizes these numbers with success/failure breakdowns and latency distribution. Access it from the Relay tab in the sidebar when Relay is enabled.

## Debugging Failed Deliveries

When a message does not reach its destination, Relay provides several tools to diagnose the issue. Start with the dead letter queue, then drill into individual traces, and check the reliability subsystems.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Check the dead letter queue

Dead letters are messages that could not be delivered to any endpoint. Fetch them from the dead letters endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:4242/api/relay/dead-letters
```

Each dead letter includes the original envelope with its subject, payload, and budget. The reason for rejection is embedded in the envelope metadata. Common reasons include:

- **No matching endpoints** -- The subject has no registered endpoints. Verify the endpoint is registered with `GET /api/relay/endpoints`.
- **Budget exceeded** -- The message's hop count, TTL, or call budget was exhausted before delivery.
- **Access denied** -- The sender does not have permission to publish to the target subject. Check `access-rules.json`.
</Step>

<Step>
### Inspect the message trace

If the message was delivered but the handler failed, look up the trace:

```bash
curl http://localhost:4242/api/relay/messages/{messageId}/trace
```

Check the `status` and `error` fields on each span. A `failed` status with an error message tells you exactly what went wrong in the subscriber handler. For Claude Code adapter failures, the error typically includes the Agent SDK error message.
</Step>

<Step>
### Check endpoint health

If deliveries are being rejected, the endpoint's circuit breaker may be open. The Relay metrics endpoint reports system-level metrics, and individual endpoint health can be assessed by looking at consecutive failure patterns in the traces.

The circuit breaker opens after 5 consecutive failures (configurable in `~/.dork/relay/config.json`). After a 30-second cooldown, it allows a single probe message through. If the probe succeeds, normal delivery resumes.
</Step>

<Step>
### Check rate limits and backpressure

If a sender is publishing too quickly, their messages are rejected by the rate limiter. The default allows 100 messages per 60-second window per sender. If an endpoint's mailbox has too many unprocessed messages, backpressure kicks in at 80% capacity (warning) and 100% capacity (rejection).

Both settings are tunable in `~/.dork/relay/config.json` and hot-reloaded without a restart.
</Step>
</Steps>

### SSE Stream for Real-Time Monitoring

For real-time visibility, subscribe to the Relay SSE stream. The stream emits events for every message delivery and signal:

```bash
curl -N http://localhost:4242/api/relay/stream?subject=%3E
```

The `subject` query parameter filters which messages appear in the stream. Use `>` (URL-encoded as `%3E`) to see all messages, or provide a specific pattern like `relay.agent.*` to filter by audience.

The stream emits three event types:

| Event | Description |
|---|---|
| `relay_connected` | Initial connection confirmation with the filter pattern |
| `relay_message` | A message envelope matching the subscription pattern |
| `relay_backpressure` | A backpressure or dead-letter signal from an endpoint |

<Callout type="warn">
The SSE stream is primarily intended for debugging and monitoring. In production, use the REST API for polling metrics and the UI dashboard for visual monitoring. Long-lived SSE connections consume server resources and should be closed when no longer needed.
