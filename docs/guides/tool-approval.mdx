# Tool Approval

DorkOS gives you control over what actions Claude can take during a conversation. When tool approval is enabled, Claude will pause and ask for your permission before running certain operations.

## What is Tool Approval?

Tool approval is a safety feature that lets you review and approve (or deny) actions before Claude executes them. When Claude wants to use a tool — like reading a file, running a command, or modifying code — DorkOS will show you what Claude is planning to do and wait for your decision.

## How It Works

### Approving Tools

When Claude needs to use a tool, you'll see a tool approval card appear in the chat. This card shows:

- **Tool name** — The specific operation Claude wants to perform
- **Tool input** — The parameters or arguments for the tool (like file paths, search terms, or command arguments)
- **Approve and Deny buttons** — Your decision controls

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Review** the tool name and input to understand what Claude is about to do.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Click Approve** to allow the action. Claude will execute the tool and continue with your task.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Or click Deny** to reject the tool call. Claude will receive a denial message and choose a different approach.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
Tool approvals have a **10-minute timeout**. If you don't respond, the tool call is automatically denied and Claude continues with a different approach. This prevents sessions from hanging indefinitely.
</Callout>

### Denying Tools

If you don't want Claude to perform a specific action, click **Deny**. You can explain in your next message why you denied the action, or ask Claude to try something else.

## Question Prompts

Some tools need more than just approval — they need answers from you. When Claude uses the `AskUserQuestion` tool, you'll see an interactive question prompt instead of a simple approve/deny choice.

Question prompts show:
- **The question** — What Claude needs to know
- **Answer options** — Pre-defined choices you can select
- **Other option** — A free-text field if none of the options fit

Types of questions:
- **Single-select questions** — Choose one option from a list (radio buttons)
- **Multi-select questions** — Choose multiple options (checkboxes)

<Steps>
  <Step>Read the question carefully.</Step>
  <Step>Select one or more options, or enter your own answer in the "Other" field.</Step>
  <Step>Click **Submit** to send your answers back to Claude.</Step>
</Steps>

Your answers are injected into the tool's input, and Claude continues with your selections incorporated into its reasoning.

## Permission Modes

DorkOS supports different permission modes that control when tool approval is required:

- **Default mode** — Every tool call requires approval (maximum control)
- **Auto-approve mode** — Tools run automatically without approval (faster, less control)

The permission mode is set when you start a new session. You can see the current mode in the session info.

## Common Scenarios

### File Operations

When Claude wants to read, write, or modify files, you'll see tool calls like `Read`, `Write`, and `Edit`. Review the file paths carefully to ensure Claude is working with the right files.

### Search Operations

Tools like `Grep` and `Glob` search for files or content. Check the search patterns to make sure Claude is searching in the right places.

### Command Execution

The `Bash` tool runs terminal commands. Always review the command to ensure it's safe and does what you expect.

<Callout type="warn">
Always review `Bash` tool calls carefully before approving. Terminal commands can modify files, install packages, or run network operations. When in doubt, deny and ask Claude to explain.
</Callout>

### Web Access

Tools like `WebFetch` and `WebSearch` access the internet. Review the URLs or search queries to ensure they're appropriate.

## Tips

- **Review carefully**: Tool inputs can be long or complex. Take time to read through the parameters to understand exactly what Claude is doing.
- **Deny when uncertain**: If you're not sure what a tool does or why Claude wants to use it, it's safer to deny and ask Claude to explain.
- **Context matters**: Sometimes Claude will explain why it needs a tool before asking for approval. Read the full assistant message.
- **Question prompts are flexible**: When presented with options, you can always choose "Other" and provide a custom answer.
